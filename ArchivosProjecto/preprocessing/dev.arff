'capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace . \nthere is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . \njohn carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself . \n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) . \njohn carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes . \nfor a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make . \nghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace . \nin addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue . \nthis film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness . \nit is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way . \nbut that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience . \nghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 . \nmars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film\'s budget ) . \nit is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film . \nsociety has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little . \napparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control . \nand from carpenter\'s view , women have really made a mess of things . \nsociety has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten . \nthe basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony . \ninstead of having the criminal \" napolean \" wilson , this film has the criminal \" desolation \" williams . \ninstead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars . \nbecause the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination . \nthe story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . \nghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . \ncarpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . \nsadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . \nthe terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . \nhis idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring . \nthese are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience . \nsomewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights . \nwithin a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars . \nafter mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by . \ni rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nfollowing the movie i showed my wife , who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did , carpenter\'s classic assault on precinct 13 . \nher comment is that it was seeing the same film twice . \n',neg
'so ask yourself what \" 8mm \" ( \" eight millimeter \" ) is really all about . \nis it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? \nis it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there\'s a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won\'t necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? \nor is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ? \ni\'m not talking about snuff films , supposed \" documentaries \" of victims being brutalized and killed on camera . \ni\'m talking about films like \" 8mm \" and its director , joel schumacher . \nwith a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- \" batman & robin , \" \" a time to kill , \" \" batman forever , \" \" the client \" --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence . \nis \" 8mm \" something you really want to see ? \nprobably not . \nthe first two-thirds of \" 8mm \" unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core . \nthen , as it\'s been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence . \nand just when you think it\'s finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further . \ntrust me . \nthere are better ways to waste two hours of your life . \nnicolas \' \" snake eyes \" \' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband\'s safe documents a young girl\'s murder . \nwelles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don\'t need any specialized skills or training to do this . \nwelles certainly makes it look easy . \nand cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues . \nthe deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schrader\'s \" hardcore . \" \noccasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task . \nthere are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa . \n \" 8mm \" doesn\'t condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it . \nthe irony , of course , is that schumacher and \" seven \" scribe andrew kevin walker\'s vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product . \nso we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror . \nlater it\'s the turn of joaquin phoenix ( who\'s quite good and by far the film\'s most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again . \nall this to get to the familiar yet offensive \" revelation \" that sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me . \nneither super nor standard , \" 8mm \" is shocking only in its banality . \n',neg
'a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \nfirst , there\'s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \nno no . . . \njust kidding . \nhad you going there for a moment , didn\'t i ? \nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it\'s 5 billion inhabitants ) . \nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \ni\'d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn\'t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn\'t try to overachieve . \nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \nshao khan has decided that he\'s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \ntoo bad they didn\'t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \n * the acting is truly bad . \nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i\'ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he\'s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn\'t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \n . . . unless you\'re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \nsonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \n * there aren\'t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \nsilly , silly folks . \nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \n * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" \nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . \nyou\'ll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . \n',neg
' \" snake eyes \" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing . \nit\'s not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he\'s a great director and one who\'s films are always greeted with at least some fanfare . \nand it\'s not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents . \nit\'s worse than that . \nit\'s aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness . \nor more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness . \nin certain circles , \" snake eyes \" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa\'s classic \" rashomon , \" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb . \nin one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who\'s character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who\'s also in this ) , and watches as it happens . \nthere\'s a big name in the crowd , and that\'s the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who\'s sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out . \nthis all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction . \nwhat really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and \ndiscovers there\'s a very good possibility it was a conspiracy . \nas we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness\' takes on what happened . \nthis is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it\'s extremely interesting to watch . . . then \nit takes one wrong step . \nwe follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out . \nbut that\'s not the worst part of it : it\'s that it\'s the one person you didn\'t think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn\'t think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it . \nit only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can\'t rely on rick\'s investigation to be all that interesting . \nit\'s as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible . \nevents become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina . \nthat\'s where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay . \nthis time , it\'s a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena . \nwhat went wrong ? \ndepalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . \ndepalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , \" blow out , \" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . \nbut granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . \nat least his direction makes up partly for it . \nthen there\'s koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character\'s flaws come to life like he did in depalma\'s earlier \" carlito\'s way , \" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . \nhe can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . \nhe\'s flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn\'t so formulaic . \na scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . \nhe may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . \nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . \nas i was watching the first half hour , i couldn\'t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he\'d be given , and perhaps he\'d have to make a choice between who\'s he has to believe . \nnow there\'s a film . \nunfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we\'ve seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma . \n',neg
'some movies i should just skip . \nmy daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program . \ntrue , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it\'s a cartoon . \nbut it\'s a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen . \nbut my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? \nturns out i was right , mostly . \ninspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick . \nat first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver . \nthis odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where \" formula \" isn\'t just business , it\'s a way of life . \nthe producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits . \nin some parts you can just hear them saying \" more zany ! \ni want more zany here -- and -- here . \" \n \" let\'s have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . \ni want the audience squirming in their seats . \" \n \" ok , that\'s fine , but i want you to add bug guts . \" \n \" what does this scene do ? \ncharacter depth ? \nbut where\'s the zaniness ? \ni don\'t see zany here . \nif you can\'t make it zany , cut it ! \" \nthe latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie . \nmichelle ( who plays penny , gadget\'s niece ) shines in every scene she\'s in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time . \nmy guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor . \ndabney coleman\'s comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby . \ni kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes . \nhe is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the \" gidget bitch from hell \" town mayor . \noteri\'s overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon\'s own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn\'t poking fun at our fair town . \nor , maybe all career politicians are like that . \ni must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla . \nhe appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget . \nrupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw . \njoely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself . \nher performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film . \nd . l . hughley plays the shuckin\'-and-jivin\' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years . \nthe dialog is . . . let\'s face it , it\'s pretty bad . \nthe tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context . \na lot of the lines ( especially hughley\'s ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib . \nabout three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw . \ngadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really \" battles \" ) with the evil gadget . \npenny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon . \nlet me rage here just for a minute . \nmichelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character . \nshe\'s utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective . \nwhy she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery . \nthe film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity . \ninspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it\'s a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment . \nprobably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits . \nthe \" evil sidekick support group \" is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it\'s onscreen . \nall in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films . \ni wonder if disney uses the revenues for it\'s generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers . \nbut if true , why ? \nif they\'re trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it . \n',neg
' \" lake placid \" marks yet another entry in the series of \" predator pics \" that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- \" jaws \" ) and were revived recently by the godawful \" anaconda . \" \n \" placid \" claims to be a \" horror/comedy \" -it\'s directed by the same guy who did \" house \" -but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of \" anaconda . \" \npaleontologist kelly scott ( bridget fonda ) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake . \ndiscovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile ( which shouldn\'t even be in this hemisphere ) , kelly goes croc-hunting with game warden jack wells ( bill pullman ) and sheriff hank keough ( brendan gleeson ) . \nthey\'re joined by an unwelcome guest , hector cyr ( oliver platt ) , a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them . \nalong the way , the merry band meets mrs . delores bickerman ( betty white ) , a weird old lady who lives out on the lake . \nyou know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone\'s dangling legs while \" jaws \" -like music plays , one character ( hector ) who\'s obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest , another character who insists that the predator can\'t possibly exist . \nunlike its slippery cousin \" anaconda , \" \" lake placid \" wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek , which is self-defeating . \nthe result is neither scary nor funny ; it\'s just tedious . \nwhile director steve miner has several horror films on his resume ( including two installments of \" friday the 13th \" and \" halloween h20 \" ) , screenwriter david kelley ( best known as the creator of tv series like \" ally mcbeal \" and \" chicago hope \" ) doesn\'t seem to have the stomach for a chomp \'em up flick . \nthe body count is surprisingly low and doesn\'t include any of the major characters , and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it . \n ( \" lake placid \" manages to have it both ways-i\'ll let you discover how for yourself ) . \nthe croc itself is mostly computer-generated , of course . \nlike the snake in \" anaconda , \" the thirty-foot monster crocodile doesn\'t seem real ; it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural . \n \" lake placid \" also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine . \nthere is a lot of semi-mystical mumbo jumbo about how \" we really don\'t know much about crocodiles . \" \nthey would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers . \na movie like this doesn\'t have to offer much of an explanation ( radioactive mutant ? \ncreature from outer space ? ) , but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on . \npullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto-pilot . \nmost of the time , they\'re probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers . \nplatt and white , on the other hand , seem to be giving their best efforts , and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script . \n',neg
'the classic story & the production which ruined it \nmarking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h . g . wells classic , new line cinema , armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man stan winston ( alien , predator , terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel . \nof course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies , one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls ( sounds like a much better title . . ) . \nthe story begins with edward douglas ( thewlis ) , a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific , who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery ( kilmer ) after his plane crashes into the sea . \ndouglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr . moreau , who incidently , owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize . \nhis host\'s reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau\'s lab , when a monstrous birth was in progress . \neven worse , the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal \" people . \" \ndouglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast-people community , which considers dr . moreau their maker . \nusing shock-therapy and the law , dr . moreau has long been able to keep his beast-people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal-men who are just too savage to be controlled . \nthe island of dr . \nmoreau questions the ability of men playing god . \ndr . moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence . . . but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long . \nmoreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp . \neven so , the production has failed to make the most out of it . \nthere are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is , the characters are not \" prioritized \" so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important , before they know it , he or she or it perishes . . . . rather \nungloriously at times too . \nperhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people , especially aissa ( balk ) , the most human of moreau\'s creations . \nthe two very important characters , montgomery and dr . moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably . \nmore screen time could have been used for character interaction and development . \ni really would have liked it better if , say , they delved more into dr . moreau\'s obsession , montgomery\'s purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast-people had to rebel . \nmaybe the nature of the screenplay , which incidently , does not incorporate much action sequences in the film , forced the filmmakers to \" cut a long story short \" and make it more of an action film than anything else ( it\'s still summer , and movies have to be \" marketable \" ) . \nthe special effects too , are really nothing for anyone to shout about . \nat most , i would say the beast-men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes . \nthis h . g . wells classic really has potential to be a good film . \nunfortunately , after 2 adaptations , they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story . \nas a third outing , the island of dr . moreau \naccomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of `the planet of the apes\' . \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n',neg
'lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient . \ngreat acting , music and cinematography were nice , but too many dull sub-plots and characters made the film hard to follow . \nralph fiennes ( strange days , schindler\'s list ) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy , a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy . \nthe story revolves around his past , in flashback form , making it even more confusing . \nanyway , he is taken in by hana ( juliette binoche , the horseman on the roof ) , a boring war-torn nurse . \nshe was never really made into anything , until she met an indian towards the end , developing yet another sub-plot . \ncount almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger ( willem dafoe , basquiat ) . \nhis love ( kirstin scott thomas , mission impossible ) was severely injured in a plane crash , and eventually died in a cave . \nhe returned to find her dead and was heart-broken . \nso he flew her dead body somewhere , but was shot down from the ground . \ndon\'t get the wrong idea , it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting , but good is the last thing this film is . \nmaybe if it were an hour less , it may have been tolerable , but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle . \nthe only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography . \nother than these , the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film . \n , \n',neg

'would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you\'d be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta-jones ? \nlet me tell you what reality is . \nreality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot . \nthat\'s reality . \namerica\'s sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also-ran , presumably because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh-huh ) . \nthe plot follows two married , mega-movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta-jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle\'s release , a film called time over time . \nthe only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( think meg and dennis ) . \ngosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage . \nveteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting they haven\'t seen the movie at all . \n ( note to sony : any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab . ) \nand did i mention gwen\'s sister kiki ( roberts ) is along for the ride ? \nand that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ? \noh billy , you\'re a scamp ! \nthe script you\'ve co-written with peter tolan ( what planet are you from ? \nand bedazzled -- need i say more ? ) is a roast of hollywood and celebrity , sure , but it\'s not a funny one . \nyes , crystal tells us , hollywood is lying to our faces ! \nif you are surprised by this , you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine . \nit\'s about to expire . \naside from a scant few zingers ( yeah , se ? or winces rules ! ) , \namerica\'s sweethearts\' jokes aren\'t funny , its pace is choppy , and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project -- not for headlining star julia roberts -- but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself . \ni didn\'t time it ( the movie\'s not that bad ) , but it\'s crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film . \nbad move , billy -- your jokes suck . \nthe crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie\'s gags -- and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene , how this movie earned a pg-13 rating is a mystery to me . \njulia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend\'s wedding into a winning film , but not even that 90-tooth smile can save her here . \nobviously aware of the ugliness before him , director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria ( as a lisping spaniard ) , christopher walken ( the insane time over time director ) , and alan arkin ( a new age guru in a fright wig ) to crack wise . \nnone of the stereotypes is successful except for walken ; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he\'s supposed to be macho . \nas for roth , in case you don\'t know , went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio , revolution , which produced this work . \nhe\'s back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years . \nit\'ll probably be another 11 before he\'s back again . \ni could drone on about how america\'s sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth-breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies , but that would get old . \ninstead , i\'ll settle for discussing the movie\'s worst sin : that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable , not just in its plot but in its sentiment . \nevery single character in this film ( with the arguable exception of kiki ) is simply hateful , and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains . \nwhen you leave the theater , you\'ll ask yourself , too : why would i want any of these jerks to be happy ? \n',neg
'mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect . \na weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile . \nhowever , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie\'s best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever . \njackie chan plays , who else , jackie . \nthis time out , he\'s a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show . \nnot that it ever makes a difference in the plot . \nthere are only two scenes of him cooking . \nfor the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop . \nit never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? \na tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons . \nalthough she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm , \nshades of broadcast news ? ? ? \nanyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape . \nhere lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn\'t anyone realize you can copy a tape ? \noh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense . \nas luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn\'t you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape . \nthis leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie . \nin a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language . \nhowever , that doesn\'t mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie\'s recent americanized releases . \nstrangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too . \nwhether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie\'s dubbed films . \nthe plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons . \nbut even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie\'s films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread . \nlook , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ? \nwatching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts . \nthe action is a mixed bag here . \nthere\'s really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie\'s films . \nit takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan . \nthe action in the film is neither jackie\'s best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes . \nthe film\'s gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting . \nonce or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence . \nbut to slo-mo jackie running ? \neither this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down . \nif you\'ve seen all of jackie\'s films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy . \nhowever , if you\'re just in the mood for some good action , you\'d be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop . \n',neg
'there\'s a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact . \ni\'d say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release . \nthe early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes . \ndeep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking . \nthe repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there\'s a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation\'s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \nthen we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense . \nthe mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there\'s a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation\'s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \nit goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail . \nhow do we know this ? \nbecause we\'ve seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that \" the comet is still headed right for us \" and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading . \nladies and gentlemen , that is the movie . \nsuccessful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots . \ntelevision is what\'s wrong with deep impact . \nthe main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that\'s the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy . \nshe thinks it\'s an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area . \nwhen she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps . \n \" i know you\'re just a reporter , but you used to be a human being . \" \nshe figures out what\'s really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet . \nupon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question . \nand everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you\'re a star . \nleoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet\'s collision course with earth . \nand i\'m sure it\'s comforting for her to know that , even though the world\'s ending in a matter of months , she\'s a cable news personality . \nso there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up . \nsuch personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out process . \nbut as anyone who\'s seen the commercials knows , the astronauts fail . \nthey only end up breaking the comet into two pieces , which means even more destruction to the earth . \nyeah , thanks , nasa . \nthat\'s when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren\'t picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years . \nthey even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave . \nif the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed , deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie . \ninstead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife , while people pack the highways out of town . \nthe reasoning is , of course , that if a comet is going to strike , they might as well be out in some scenic rural location . \nand , amusingly , the highway is spotted with people in u-haul trucks . \ni\'m sure it\'s comforting to know that , even though the world\'s ending in a matter of minutes , the u-haul people are doing the most business of their lives . \n',neg

'another formula \'feel good\' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like \" waking ned devine , \" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . \nit is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . \nthe strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . \nthe film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . \nbut its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . \nits message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the \'war on drugs\' is about to be escalated into colombia . \nthe drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america\'s jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america\'s drug usage and drug supply . \nbillions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . \neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . \nthe film\'s mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . \nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . \nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . \nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . \nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . \nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband\'s enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . \nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . \nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . \neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . \nher gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . \nsince she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . \nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . \nfor grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . \nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace\'s greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can\'t control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . \nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn\'t want matthew to end up in jail . \nit is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . \nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . \nthe film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . \nthings work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . \nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . \nthis \'unhip\' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . \nummm !

' \" love to kill \" starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes . \nat the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who\'s an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman . \ndanza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his . \neverything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs . \nmuch confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza\'s begin to emerge , all after one thing or another . \nsound confusing ? \nit is . \ni think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity . \nin some respects , it works . \nbut the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess . \ncharacters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen . \nthe only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman\'s sister . \nbut so little time is devoted to this part of the story , we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , we don\'t really care what happens to them . \nwell , i didn\'t , at least . \none thing i will give the movie is that it\'s a complete departure for tony danza . \nhere\'s a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , who\'s ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing . \nhere , he plays a man who\'s just looking out for himself , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin , so be it . \ni was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona . \nmichael madsen is also good as an associate of danza\'s who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him . \nlike i said , it\'s not exactly a linear storyline . \n \" love to kill \" should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre , but it\'s just too bad that the story doesn\'t really add up to much . \nthe stars deserved better , and so did the audience . \n',neg
' \" practical magic , \" is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one . \nthe film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens , two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches , spanning back 200 years . \nat the start , their parents die when they are still children , and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest ) . \nswitch to the present day , gillian , who is the stronger , more rebellious sibling , leaves home , and meets up with a dark , abusive guy ( goran visjnic ) , while sally stays in their hometown , meets and falls in love with a sweet , caring man , has two children , and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it , she\'s not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes ) . \nwhen gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic , they accidentally murder him , and in desperation , bury the body in the backyard of their aunts\' house . \nadd to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism , not to mention a spattering of \" light-hearted whimsy , \" and you have a pretty good idea how messy \" practical magic \" is . \nafter seeing the film , i reflected that there was not even one scene , or element , that i liked or enjoyed . \nit is a comedy , to be sure , but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat , and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching . \nit is not charming or entertaining in any way . \nand then to top it off , we\'ve got this dark , but bird-brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian\'s body . \nwhatever . \nthe characters are handled terribly , and actually , most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character . \nthere is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film , and in every scene involving them , they are always standing side-by-side . \nno attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people . \nthe same goes for aidan quinn , as a handsome police investigator , who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock , even though he comes into it at around the 70-minute mark , and once again , there is no attempt to develop their relationship , or his character , in any way . \nin fact , every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along , rather than getting to know the people saying the lines . \ni should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits , when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman , who managed to destroy the \" batman \" series with \" batman forever \" and \" batman and robin . \" \n \" practical magic \" is directed by griffin dunne , primarily an actor , who last year made the contrived , clumsy romance , \" addicted to love , \" with meg ryan and matthew broderick . \ni disliked that movie quite a bit , but since \" practical magic \" is even worse , that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is . \ni\'d tell him to quit while he\'s ahead , but in these last two years , he\'s ultimately already buried himself . \n',neg
'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \ni was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . \nsquandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley\'s a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain\'t ) . \nmiraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they\'d dare tempt fate and go for another round . \nso here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . \nthe film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . \nin other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there\'s a catch -- he\'s an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who\'s now infected with alien dna . \npatrick\'s overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . \nand when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick\'s primary focus turns to her -- \" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable \" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . \nspecies ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . \nhowever , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered . \nmr . brancato\'s original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . \nlike the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there\'s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . \nlast time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker\'s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- \" something bad happened here . \" \nthis time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter \" this is awful . \" \nand she\'s not even empathic ! \nand when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who\'s telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , \" he\'s going to rape her . \" \nwhile species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own . \nthere\'s an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn\'t really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( \" he\'s in aisle 1 ! \" \ninforms eve ) . \nif the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion . \nmuch of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it\'s terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief . \nthe implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve\'s brain ? \nwhy are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? \nmy favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks . \nthis is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it\'s being foisted upon the public . \nreturning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there\'s realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis . \nmykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick\'s neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film . \nmr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) . \nms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that \" she\'s so empowered . \" \na lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that\'s * what i call empowerment . \n',neg

'dead-bang , an action thriller starring don johnson , lives up to its dumb title , or at least to half of it . \nalthough dead-bang is definitely dead , it is anything but a bang ; in fact , they should have called this one \" dead bore . \" \nin the film , johnson plays . . . \nyou guessed it . . . \na cop . \nthe role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character , jerry beck , is a gritty los angeles homicide detective , a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on \" miami vice . \" \na la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life . \nbeck\'s wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children . \nshe will not even allow him to wish them \" merry christmas \" by telephone . \nbut beck\'s family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead-bang . \nbeck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop . \nhis investigation starts in l . a . and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp . \nvirtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective . \nthe plot is incoherent and full of holes . \nthe movie depicts beck\'s investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions . \nthe action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense . \ni certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate--as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii . \nin all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang\'s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction . \ndead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting . \naccording to the movie\'s production notes , dead-bang is based on the real-life experiences of still-active detective jerry beck . \nyou would never guess this from watching dead-bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable . \nmost of the characters in dead-bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above . \nwilliam forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by-the-book fbi agent who\'s offended by beck\'s foul language and unorthodox methods . \nforsythe\'s lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable . \ndead-bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid ( \" wkrp in cincinnati \" and \" frank\'s place \" ) , but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role ; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains . \nthe sole function of penelope ann miller\'s character is to give dead-bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less . \ni guess the film\'s title refers to this love scene since it\'s definitely a dead bang . \nthe only real virtue of dead-bang , believe it or not , is don johnson , who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie\'s pitiful script . \njohnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth , and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life . \nand i must admit that dead-bang does have one or two amusing moments . \nthe funniest scene has johnson throwing-up all over a criminal as he interrogates him . \nbut when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie\'s in trouble . \nthe other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can\'t keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen . \nbut two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make . \n',neg
'if you\'re the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn ( butter optional ) , then this is the movie for you ! \nindeed , this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies , or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them . \nit\'s difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film . \nbut at least we\'re warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase , giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show . \nwhat are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie ? \nfirst , the movie gives us an introductory premise . \nhuge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor , and in this area , many ships have disappeared . \noooh . . . scary ! \nsecondly , a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery , but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score . \nthird , the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo ( treat williams ) . \nhe operates a sophisticated military-style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy . \nfinally , in the cargo hold , we see those that hired him . \nthey are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts , talk with accents , and try to show how macho they are . \nduring their trip across the stormy sea , their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs . \nspotting a cruise ship in the distance , they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop , take the parts that they need , and then continue on their merry way . \nlittle do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster . \nyet , they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds . \nthis is nothing more than a by-the-book action film . \ntheir realization of the situation that they\'re in doesn\'t happen until they are in the bowels of the boat . \nthose who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed . \nthe corridors on the ship are narrow , misty , and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare-fests must have . \nyet , despite the predictable nature of this film , there are some scary \" boo \" moments . \nbut most of it is just outright silly . \nand this film is unusually gory too . \nmonsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains . \nthere is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive . \nhe screams horribly as the monster\'s digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away . \nadditionally , it borrows heavily from speed2 , alien and a bunch of other recent films . \nthe mercenaries even run into a lone , surviving passenger ( femke jannsen ) who looks amazingly like sandra bullock . \nto be honest , when i left the theatre , i just had to laugh at how witless the film was . \nit\'s moronic fun at best . \nso , if you\'re hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness , then this might just hit the spot . \n',neg
'ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his , or her , sophistication ? \nit\'s full of stops and starts and usually , the punch line is ruined . \ni felt the same way watching drowning mona . \nskip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy . \nthere are some slightly successful attempts at humor , but they only serve as window dressing . \nthere is a running gag about the town , verplanck , n . y . , being a test town for the then new yugo . \neveryone drives a yugo , differentiating their cars with personalized license plates . \neven the police chief drives one . \nthere is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets . \nthere also is a running gag about one of the characters , jeff , missing a hand and how it occurred . \nit pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends . \nit turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend . \nthere are some sight gags that pop up as well , such as mona\'s tombstone , which reads \" demoted \" , instead of devoted . \nstill , the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond . \nthe lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona ( midler ) . \neach scene with her is the same : scream at someone , hit someone , then scream some more . \nthere\'s no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness . \nanyone off the street could have played the role , such as it is . \nthe other characters are walking cardboard cutouts . \neach one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization . \nthere is a burly , female car mechanic , so of course , there is a forced lesbianism gag . \nmona\'s son , jeff ( marcus thomas ) is a simpleton , hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth . \nchief of police rash ( devito ) likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter . \nthere\'s nothing more to him . \nelle , the chief\'s daughter ( campbell ) , is bland personified , a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married . \nmona\'s husband phil ( fichtner ) jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch . \nbob ( affleck ) , elle\'s betrothed , and business partner to jeff , is a mumbling , obvious dullard . \nthere is no contrast to any of the characters . \nby having at least one character with some wit , or wits , to serve as counterpoint to the others , perhaps steinfeld\'s attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better . \nostensibly a murder mystery , drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately , then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer , who could be anyone due to mona\'s loving manner with everyone on town . \neven that aspect of the film fails , throwing in a convenient , ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things . \nit\'s been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood . \nwhat makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it\'s ineptitude . \n',neg
'watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute \'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey . \nif the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star . \nalas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . \nwhat that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . \nthat\'s pretty generous , considering the movie\'s camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek . \nwhen will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . \nso why such a seemingly high rating ? \nthere are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . \nfirst , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . \nthe sound and screen kicked ass . \nnobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don\'t necessarily mean that in a good way ) . \nalso , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie\'s tension . \ni even liked the computer-generated settings . \ni usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i\'ve seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . \nalso , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . \nwilliam hurt isn\'t too bad either . \nneither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . \nand perhaps i shouldn\'t admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . \nthere is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a \" real \" kiss -- no sex ) . \nit felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . \nthose movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . \nthat type of moviemaking is a lost art . \nnow for the bad news . \nworst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue . \nit\'s squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . \n \" you better hold on to your joystick , \" is one such line . \nand when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . \nsecond worst , and closely related , is the screenplay . \nthe story\'s exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what\'s happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . \nonce the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . \nwhen gary oldman easily reprograms will\'s pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : \" he flipped the switch to \'evil . \' \" \nthen there\'s the tone of the movie . \nthe colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . \nthen it could be an adventure movie . \nthey\'re mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn\'t a good enough actor to carry it off . \nstill , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination . \njust because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn\'t mean that we have to bow to a \" promise keepers \" notion of who\'s the center of a family . \nmany quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . \nand the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . \nin star wars , the rebels were the good guys . \nwe were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . \nin lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . \nthat ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . \nfinally , a few specific details deserve criticism . \nthe movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . \nwhy ? \nwhy bother saying what year this is . \njust tell us it\'s the future . \ni bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . \nsetting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won\'t be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . \nthen there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . \nthis silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny\'s barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven\'t learned a thing about ergonomics . \none vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . \nthe strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . \nthis is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . \nbut if that\'s the best part of the movie , i can\'t in good conscience recommend it . \nstill , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your \" bad movie bingo \" cards . \n',neg

' \" goodbye , lover \" sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may , and one look will tell you why . \nit\'s a mess . \nand that\'s * way * before ellen degeneres shows up . \nthe film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that , in this case , required the services of three screenwriters . \ni suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller , one wrote a murder mystery , and one wrote a comedy , then director roland joff ? tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment . \ni didn\'t laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to ) . \ndegeneres is horrible and her character is even worse , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair . \neither degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn\'t yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist . \nevery single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip , but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid . \nher reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is \" at least she died healthy . \" \nand that\'s one of her wittier asides . \ndegeneres\' sgt . \nrita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of . . . wait . \nto give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple-crosses . \nit\'s best described this way : \nsultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake , a \" creative yet unfocused \" ( and alcoholic ) advertising rep , played by dermot mulroney . \nsandra likes to act out her deep-seated sexual fantasies and jake\'s brother ben ( the suave-as-ever don johnson ) likes to help . \nben is also coming on to his petite , mousy co-worker peggy blaine ( mary-louise parker ) and someone , somewhere , is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his . \nthe film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again . \nalthough there are some genuine surprises , the plot twists get too contrived too quickly . \nprobably around the time degeneres\' gumcracking gumshoe appears . \nat least the former \" ellen \" star is going for something a little different . \narquette turns in yet another of her stiletto-heeled , platinum blonde bombshell roles ( see : \" lost highway , \" \" true romance \" ) while quoting embarrassing lines like \" i\'m not wearing any underwear . \" \ni hope she got paid a lot of money to do this . \nhere\'s an example of some of the film\'s flat-out stupidity . \nsandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film\'s duplicitous lovers . \nshe drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite \" the sound of music \" on her car stereo , intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims . \nso what was the point of the wig and the car ? \n \" the sound of music \" stuff might be a reference to \" the wizard of oz \" allusions in david lynch\'s \" wild at heart , \" but if so joff ? must have forgotten that \" wild at heart \" was a despicable movie . \nit\'s hard to believe that \" goodbye , lover \" was directed by the same person who made \" the killing fields \" and \" the mission . \" \nit\'s not , however , hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long . \nit should have stayed there . \n',neg
'nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . \nthe opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . \nthe prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . \nif the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . \ncage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he\'s going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . \nand thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona\'s h . i . mcdonnough . \ncage should have known what he was getting himself into . \nhe got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there\'s one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it\'s that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . \nthe critical difference between the rock and con air is cage\'s performance . \nin the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . \nthat sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . \nwhile the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage\'s goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . \naudiences , too , should know what they\'re getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . \nin fact , the marketing people are counting on it . \nno one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . \ndirector simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab\'s soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it\'s perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . \nwhat he doesn\'t deliver is a moment of suspense . \na bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock\'s notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . \nif either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air\'s creepiest set-up . \nat a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . \ntheir tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . \nin fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . \nit is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . \nwhile malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . \nhis recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . \nit doesn\'t bode well for cage\'s appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . \nthere\'s a word for people like you , nicolas . \nthat word is called recidivist . . . repeat \noffender . \n',neg

'susan granger\'s review of \" jeepers creepers \" ( mgm/ua entertainment ) \nthis nasty , little horror film begins as a bickering brother ( justin long ) and sister ( gina philips ) are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped-up bodies down a drainage pipe . \nwhen long decides to investigate , there\'s nothing but trouble . \n \" you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it ? \n- well , this is it ! \" \nphilips warns . \nwhat he finds in the basement of an old , abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying , jagged-stitched incision from his neck to his navel , plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies , stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry . \nlong flees but now the monstrous , winged creeper ( jonathan breck ) is after both of them ! \neileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle , a psychic who explains the evil creature\'s bizarre feeding habits . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" jeepers creepers \" is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion , giving new meaning to the old song \" jeepers creepers . \" \nand now - as paul harvey would say - for the rest of the story . \nwhat\'s more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writer/director victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 year-old actor in california . \nsentenced to three years in prison , he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992 . \nwhen salva made \" powder \" ( 1995 ) , the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities , disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as a pedophile . \nand now , once again , in this mgm/ua film , that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio . \n',neg
'this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times . \nit is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam . \nit is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news . \nthe love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn\'t mean much , since their relationship remained undeveloped . \nthe introduction of the wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the star of the film , adrien brody as ray . \nray is the only son of a low-level mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield , new jersey , suburban basement . \nray sr . ( vincent ) is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home-repair business . \nhis son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman , dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his long-time waitress girlfriend joanne ( sybil ) . \nthe title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman-10b , which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film . you \nshould be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don\'t make sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them . \ndesperate to make his dream come through , ray goes to a loanshark , humorously and menacingly played by james e . moriarty , and borrows 10 grand to bet on a \" sure thing \" at freehold raceway . \nthe horse loses and now ray has big problems , as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough . \nthere is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray . \nhe is undependable , mean-spirited , and stupid . \nso when his best friend mike ( gallagher ) , the narrator of the film , gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriend--who cares ? \nthe director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do . \nas for ray\'s gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen . \nhis buddies , the college student mike and the dependable butchie ( gillan ) , and his old man , who he has this love/hate relationship with , rally to his aid . \nand the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity , that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films , as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together . \nthere was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting , though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star . \nbecause of his intensity and looks , he reminds me of sean penn . \n',neg
'capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence . \nvisually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver\'s travels and treat it as an action film . \nthat makes it a film without much center . \n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \npierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire . \nit reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver\'s travels . \nhumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift\'s island of the houyhnhnms . \nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet . \nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that . \nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish . \nthe final irony of the original version has become film history . \nwithout it there could never have been a \" planet of the apes \" film series . \ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language . \nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language . \nthat could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking . \nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film . \njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending . \nbut serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear . \nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history . \npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith\'s best if not his best . \nwhen the film\'s success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s . \nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases . \nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 . \nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again . \nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton\'s new version is even less faithful . \nfirst , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes . \nhe has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes . \nthat could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes . \nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring . \nin 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world\'s most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes . \nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet . \n ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . ) \nhe quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks . \nand the language they talk is earth- english . \napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that . \nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn\'t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film . \nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english . \nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships . \noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic . \nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter . \nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power . \nshe is bent on making the world a better place . \nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari . \nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film . \nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward . \nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes . \nthis is a further abandonment of the source material . \nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each\'s place in this reversed society , each important in the book . \nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down . \nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them . \nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn . \nthis is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in . \nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win . \nthe 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like \" i never met an ape i didn\'t like , \" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character . \nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals . \nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog . \nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup . \nin general it seems much improved from 1968 . \nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version . \nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper . \nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion . \nchambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker . \ntoday audiences have higher expectations ; baker\'s visualization is really an improvement . \nthese visuals work nicely . \nwhat does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . \nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \napes spring incredible distances . \nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost . \none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up . \nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up . \nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti . \nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes . \nbut he delivers them very well . \nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom . \nas the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well . \nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . \nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov\'s performance in spartacus . \nas an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . \ndanny elfman\'s score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith\'s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic . \nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten . \ni rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n',neg
'the second serial-killer thriller of the month is just awful . \noh , it starts deceptively okay , with a handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work . \nafter a baby-sitter gets gutted in the suit- ably spooky someone\'s-in-the-house prologue , parallel stories unfold , the first involving a texas sheriff ( r . lee emery ) , a gruesome double murder , and the arrival of a morose fbi agent ( dennis quaid ) on the eve of voting for the local lawman\'s reelection . \nthe second pairs a hitch- hiker ( jared leto ) with a friendly former railroad worker ( danny glover ) . \nthey\'re headed west , toward the rockies and away from the murder scene . \nwhich one is the killer ? \nwell , it doesn\'t really matter , \'cause when writer/first-time director jeb stuart ( die hard ) finally spills the beans , you won\'t take his choice seriously anyway . \nthe whole thing goes south about an hour in , with the tale taking hairpin turns that i certainly couldn\'t follow . \nand through the whole thing there\'s quaid , playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea- gal . \ni guess i\'m glad that i didn\'t walk out-- there\'s some nice train stuff at the end and a fun nod to dr . \nstrangelove . \n',neg
'for \" original sin , \" the road to the screen has been rocky . \ninitially slated for release last november , the film was bumped twice , finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 . \nadvance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics , generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands . \nso is \" original sin \" really all that bad ? \nyes it is , but the melodrama does offer some rewards . \nthe location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a ( with angelina jolie providing the \" t \" and antonio banderas the \" a \" ) . \nmore importantly , the movie is entertainingly bad . \nveteran readers know that , as a rule , i don\'t encourage people to patronize lousy films . \nmost of the time , there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides , the \" let\'s go laugh at the failings of others \" mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable . \nbut things are different this summer . \nquality films , to put it mildly , have been few and far between , so as far as i\'m concerned , it\'s fair to find our kicks where we may . \n \" original sin \" will never join such treasures as \" valley of the dolls , \" \" road house \" and \" showgirls \" in the bad movie hall of fame , but it\'ll do until something worse comes along . \nthe film , adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel , \" waltz into darkness \" ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film , \" mississippi mermaid \" ) , opens in a turn-of-the-century prison , as jolie\'s character , slated for a dawn execution , tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny . \nthe freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like , \" this is not a love story , it is a story about love . \" \nwary of local gold-diggers , cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas ( banderas ) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america , listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold-diggers . \na practical man , luis chooses a frumpy looking lady , hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children . \nimagine his surprise when his fianc ?

'at the outset of swordfish , john travolta\'s gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . \nbasically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . \nhow ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . \nswordfish is loud , violent and amoral . \nit has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . \nand how does travolta\'s gabriel plan to do this ? \nby robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists . \nswordfish is a very cynical movie . \nit relies on an audience\'s perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . \nthe movie\'s plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you\'d actually see how ridiculous it all is . \nthis is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it\'s over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . \nthe storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government\'s computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign . \ntalk about whacked-out patriotism . \nmy objections to swordfish are many . \nthe body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort . \nit\'s becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits . \nanother example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife . \nstanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . \naudience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband\'s adult films . \nthus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . \nin fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . \nthen there is the sequence involving one of gabriel\'s henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley\'s daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . \nchildren as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films . \nthere is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well . \nyea , it\'s only make believe , but that doesn\'t mean you have to tolerate it . \ntravolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel . \nhis character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off . \njackman looks dour through most of the proceedings . \nhis only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database . \nhis sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate . \nhalle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel\'s assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel . \nswordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel . \nviewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain . \nand maybe that is the movie\'s underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive . \nand that is not enough . \nthis is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water . \n',neg
'battlefield long , boring and just plain stupid \nbattlefield earth \na film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman \nin my mid-teen years , i had a horrendous re-occurring nightmare . \nbehind the wheel of a car , i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert . \nno scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway . \nno matter what i did , the view didn\'t change : travelling but not getting anywhere . \neach time i awoke in a sweat , terrified . \nyou don\'t have to be carl jung to understand that dream . \npowerless to make changes , trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue , this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake . \nthis is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after \" battlefield earth \" begins . \nfor all of its flash and style , l . ron hubbard\'s science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000 . \ndull \" and \" stupid . \nin the year 3000 , the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1 , 000 years . \nhumans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians . \nthere\'s no hope . \nthe future is bleak . \nthen the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry pepper ) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl ( john travolta ) and the alien race . \nit\'s an archetypal post-apocalyptic plot full of promise . \nconsidering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen , it\'s difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably . \nbut it does . \nthe story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits . \nare we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold , the psychlo never discovered fort knox ? \nor that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time -- and gassed up ? \nor that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships ? \nor that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don\'t notice that their slaves are missing for days ? \ntravolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he\'s worth and is almost entertaining . \nalmost . \nthe rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person -- \" man-animal \" or not -- would ever utter . \nsome of the film _looks_ good , but it also looks so familiar . \na race of large hulking ape-like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin . \nsound like something charlton heston might be in ? \nthe psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from \" dune \" . \nthe final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high-tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with . \nit\'s too loud . \nit\'s too oppressive . \nit\'s too slow . \nit\'s too long . . . far \ntoo long . \nand on it goes . \nthe list of the problems with \" battlefield earth \" is endless . \nit\'s difficult to find anything in the film that does work . \noh yeah . \nthe color scheme is nice . \nthe real question is how this movie ever got made . \ncould it have something to do with the fact that l . ron hubbard was the founder of scientology ? \nand that john travolta is a member of the church . \nthat might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago . \nbut it doesn\'t give us a clue as to why first-time screenwriter corey mandell\'s atrocious script was used . \nor why the high-profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film . \nor why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems . \nthe one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costner\'s \" the postman \" ( which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure ) be \" the \" big budget science fiction failure . \n \" battlefield earth \" has the honor sewed up . \noften reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video . \nthat\'s not the case here . \nyou can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one . \ndon\'t hesitate . \nstrike now while the iron is cold . \n',neg
'hey , i\'ve got a great idea for a movie ! \nok , here it is : we\'ll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so ! \nwhat\'s that ? \nsounds too boring ? \nok , how about this then : we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours , but half of them are angry looks and half of them are \" i\'m in pain ! \" \nlooks ! \nwhat\'s that ? \nthat still doesn\'t sound funny to you ? \nhow about if we through in some \" ewwwww ! \" \nlooks ? \nstill not funny ? \nif you answered \" no , that doesn\'t sound funny \" , then ( ding ding ding ! ) \nyou\'re absolutely correct ! \nfor richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple ( played by tim allen and kirstie alley ) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant ( wayne knight , best know as newman on tv\'s \" seinfeld \" ) gets them in trouble for tax evasion . \nwhat ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell . \nwhat makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs . \n . \n . \nnamely , talent ! \nbacking up , the married couple is brad and caroline sexton ( allen and alley ) , a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else , but in reality are on the brink of divorce . \njust as their marriage seems to be hanging from it\'s final thread , brad discovers that his accountant , bob lachman ( knight ) , has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton\'s names . \nthe irs catches on , but since everything points back to the sexton\'s and not lachman , there is nothing much to do . \n . \n . \nexcept run away and join an amish community . \nfirst time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle-out-loud moments , and even some decent laughs here and * way * over there , but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you\'ll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn . \nalley is absolutely unwatchable , and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade ( which , i inform you , was total b . s . ) . \nallen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons , nor are they very convincing as an amish couple ! \nthis entire movie is one bad ill-conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning ! \nthe amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing . \nit\'s such a trite , stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast ( noticing that they\'re all predominantly tv figures ) were probably the only ones they could get ! \nbryan spicer\'s directing doesn\'t help one bit , either . \nin fact , listing spicer\'s filmography ( which includes the first \" power rangers \" movie and the big screen adaption of mchale\'s navy ) is more of an insult than a r ? sum ? ! \nnow that i\'ve pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground , i will let you in on the best thing about it . \nit bumped seven films up a notch on my \" worst of \" 1997 movie list . \nthat\'s right , thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the year\'s worst , six films are now not seemingly as bad , and a smile like yours , previously inhabiting the number ten spot , now doesn\'t have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list . \nif you look at it in that respect , for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all ! \n',neg
'even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material , as this subpar submarine comedy proves . \ndown periscope stars kelsey \" frasier \" grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer\'s ( james coburn ) plan to get him out of the navy . \nlike any lame emsemble comedy , the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out , the fat guy who eats all the time , the beautiful woman who doesn\'t belong there ( lauren holly ) , the second-in-command who does everything by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out ( harry dean stanton ) and so on . \nthen comes the transparent plotline . \nfirst grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him , and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard . \nafter the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who can\'t connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone . \nfinally , and this covers the final hour of the movie , grammer has to lead his men ( and holly ) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise . \nand he has to be a clever rebel to do it , in scenes that stretch all levels of believability . \nfirst they\'re singing \" louie louie \" like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they\'re making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off . \nthe whole while , evil captain coburn is overacting underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too ) . \nit\'s all predictable without any original humor to redeem it . \nthe jokes are right out of \" mchale\'s navy \" and other cut-rate sitcoms of the past . \nthere\'s one scene where schneider looks through the ship\'s pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces , \" this expired in 1966 ! \" \ni yelled back at the screen , \" so did these jokes . \" \ni watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it . \nmy mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and , around the start of the second hour , i started writing my will . \nthe blame can\'t really be placed on the stars , though . \nkelsey grammer is good in this , he just doesn\'t have anything to work with . \nhis character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had \" welcome aboard \" tatooed on his penis . \ngrammer probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about . \nsame for holley ( save the penis part ) , who is likeable in down periscope just because she\'s so gorgeous . \nas for schneider ( whose character is downright annoying ) , there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas , although he\'s still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the \" snl \" ship . \nmy theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy ( \" okay , it\'s police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber . \" ) and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster . \njudging from the video box , most other movie critics agree with me . \nthe only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel\'s jim ferguson . \ni guess even jeff craig from \" 60 second preview \" ( who said tank girl \" kicks butt ! \" \nwithout ever seeing it ) didn\'t like this . \n',neg
'movies don\'t come much more ridiculously titled than \" i still know what you did last summer , \" but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous , the title sort of works as a warning . \nmore than a silly-sounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor , this horror sequel\'s moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot : what \" you \" did _last_ summer \" you \" actually did the summer _before_ last summer , and since \" i \" knew about it _this_ summer as well as _last_ summer , it\'s really illogical to say that \" i \" _still_ know what \" you \" did _last_ summer . \nthe filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter \" i still know , \" the longer \" i still know what you did two summers ago \" or the appropriate \" stupid people getting hacked to bits . \" \nthat last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart . \nfor example , if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago , would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet , even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress ? \nprobably not , but that\'s precisely what college student karla ( pop diva brandy ) does to best friend julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights . \njulie , you\'ll recall , was one of the sole survivors at the end of 1997\'s surprise hit \" i know what you did last summer , \" after a slasher with a grudge to bear - it\'s a _long_ story - began trying to pick off her , her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village . \nin this installment , the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas , and julie , yet racked by guilt , decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind . \nyeah , right . \ntheir island paradise has room , of course , for one more in the form of the still-alive killer ( muse watson ) from the first film . \nhe sports the same gorton\'s fisherman get-up , a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity , but why he\'s still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves . . . \nthough i suppose his hook-hand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit . \nin a sense , that\'s the movie\'s glaring flaw - everybody knows who the bad guy is , thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel . \nthe murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary , but trey callaway\'s derivative \" i still know \" screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims . \nwhen julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed , giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all , what does he do ? \nhe twist-ties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays - you\'d think he\'d want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later . \neven prequel \" summer \" lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neat-o shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh . \nthe innovative gallows humor that scribe ( and \" scream \" wunderkind ) kevin williamson injected into \" i know \" \'s unfolding story is sorely missed , replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like \" yo \" ; you\'ll cheer - not shriek - when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest . \nif \" i know what you did last summer , \" however effective , was just the kind of movie that those subversive \" scream \" flicks poked fun at , then the deadly \" i still know what you did last summer \" deserves a full-blown roasting on \" mystery science theatre 3000 . \" \n',neg
'synopsis : a humorless police officer\'s life changes when he befriends a super-smart , super-adorable golden retriever named einstein and a cute , young blond scientist . \nunfortunately , einstein shares a psychic link with a bigfoot-sized ape-creature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine , and this rogaine-nightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl . \nmeanwhile , a group of white , chain-smoking , gun-toting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie . \ncomments : watchers reborn , a cheaply made direct-to-video turkey , is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz\'s bestselling novel watchers . \ntechnically , this should have been called watchers v , but it seems that this cycle of horror movies , much like many other sequel-crazy film series , has decided to drop the numbers from the titles . \n ( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi . ) \nthe makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago . \nthis really isn\'t a good movie . \nhave you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ? \nwell , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he\'s seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn . \nthey\'re awful . \nthese commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an \" action \" movie called detonator starring scott baio . \nscott baio ! \nwhat idiot dreamed this movie up ? \nafter surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn . \n \" maybe it won\'t be * that * bad \" he may say to himself . \n \" perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading . \nwatchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago . \nit stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy . \nlou rawls is even in the mix ! \" \nunfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book . \nthe latter is really too bad . \nkoontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer . \nkoontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful . \npeople who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices . \nit\'s definately not a koontz book if there isn\'t ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people\'s eyeballs . \nwatchers has all three devices , which may explain why it\'s arguably the most popular of koontz\'s books . \nthe idea behind koontz\'s novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting . \nbasically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target\'s position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat . \nsilly but kind of neat too . \ni\'m sorry . \ni don\'t mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie . \ni suppose i just don\'t want to talk about the movie itself . \nthis turkey is really cheesy . \nno one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it\'s difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero . \nthe cheese factor is only increased when he\'s involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever-the-f * * k-she\'s-supposed-to-be whom he befriends . \nmercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity . \nto be honest , the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein . \nyou know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts . \ni find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie . \nand the creature ! \nyes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling . \nthis creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it\'s okay . \nthe creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing . \noh , he can also rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around . \ncheesy gore . \nthat\'s another main element of watchers reborn . \nit has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film\'s campiness rather than its suspense . \nultimately , i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci-fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film\'s silliness ( though this film will tax even their patience -- it\'s an 83 minute film , but it feels like four hours ) . \nalso , i hate to admit , i have survived far worse than this . \nanyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin : fear the rush will know what i mean . \nfinally , i couldn\'t help but think that watchers reborn would work well as \" bot fodder \" for the creative folks behind one of my all-time favorite shows , \" mystery science theater 3000 . \" \nthis thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face . \nrated r , watchers reborn contains dozens of blood-spattered bodies and unconvincing gore . \nit also has violence , obviously . \ni wouldn\'t recommend it for the little kids , but i\'m sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay . \ninstead of watching this film , however , i recommend reading koontz\'s book . \ntrust me , it\'ll be time much , much better spent . \n',neg

\nmaybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him . \nit\'s pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom . \nplease read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest . \nin 1986 i remember watching a movie called \" wisdom \" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do . \nwhat i like to call \" guess what , it was all a dream \" scenario . \nin \" wisdom \" the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters \" wake up \" from an apparent and say \" gosh , i\'m glad that didn\'t really happen ! \" . \ni considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with . \nwell , the same thing happens in \" the devils advocate \" , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90\% of the film didn\'t happen . \ni know it\'s a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that . \nof course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one . \nas i recall , \" wisdom \" was a decent film . \n \" the devil\'s advocate \" is not . \nthe devils advocate \ndirected by taylor hackford john milton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . al pacino kevin lomax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . keanu \nreeves mary ann lomax . . . . . . . . . . . charlize \ntheron mrs . lomax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . judith \nivey eddie barzoon . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . jeffrey jones christabella . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . connie \nnielson \nwritten by randy turgeon , march 18 , 1998 . \n',neg

'porter stoddard ( warren beatty ) is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie ( diane keaton ) for twenty-five years . \nthey and best friends mona ( goldie hawn ) and griffin ( garry shandling ) are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen , \" town and country . \" \n \" town and country \" has a pedigree befitting it\'s title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry ( \" the graduate \" ) under the direction of peter chelsom ( \" funny bones \" ) . \nafter years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates , the media has been prepped for beatty\'s next \" ishtar . \" \nso , is it that bad ? \nthe answer is no . \nbut it\'s not very good either . \nthe major problem with \" town and country \" is that it\'s unstructured and random . \nstoddard is immediately established as a philanderer , having just bedded a flaky cellist ( nastassja kinski ) . \nnext scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin . \nthen mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings ( buck henry cameos as both couples\' divorce lawyer ) . \nellie thinks she\'s overeacting , but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family\'s mississippi manse . \nthe two childhood friends end up in bed together , making us wonder why they\'d never become a couple to begin with . \nback home , their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter\'s cheating on her . \nporter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley , idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he\'s gay . \nthe four friends , along with every woman porter\'s dallied with , all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after . \nalthough the film begins promisingly , resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps , too many strands drift off into nowhere . \nthe stoddard household is huge , containing two adult children ( josh hartnett , \" the virgin suicides \" and tricia vessey , \" kiss the girls \" ) , their colorful bedmates and a maid who\'s just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home . \nafter an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack , the six supporting players are dropped except for an out-of-nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son . \nporter\'s romantic misadventures with women ( other than mona ) are equally mishandled . \nonce the marital discord begins , the film seems as if it was editted with a machete , stopping and starting , never regaining its rhythm . \nwhile beatty gets off a few tart observations , his character is mostly passive and bemused . \nmaybe we\'re supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn\'t initiate his own sex romps ? \nkeaton\'s ellie has a trusting nature that\'s a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character . \nhawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of \" the out of towners \" and \" the first wives\' club \" while shandling\'s relegated to true second banana status . \nkinski is bland and unmotivated . \nandie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay\'s most bizarre subplot , which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting , billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic , wheelchair-bound , foul-mouthed mother . \nheston and seldes are fun , as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party . \noscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look , but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like \" hear my song \" and \" funny bones . \" \nthe script is this film\'s weakest link - it\'s telling that most of the ( few ) laughs come from old-fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in a bear suit . \nwhile \" town and country \" isn\'t exactly painful to sit through , it mostly just lays there . \n',neg
' * * the following review contains spoilers * * \n \" please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie . \" \n-- chuck dowling , the jacksonville film journal \ni wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997\'s batman and robin . \napparently , no one heard my words . \noh , how i wish you had heard them . \noh how i wish someone had stopped him . . . \nbecause he\'s done it again . \nthe plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale . \nin fact , it was everything that 8mm is not . \nin the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u . s . government . \nkeep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves . \nhe returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it\'s important as well ) . \nhe\'s hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery . \nafter her husband\'s death she comes across a film in his private safe . \nit appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera . \nthe woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film . \nso he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film . \nthe main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless . \nwelles is actually selected for the case by the old woman\'s lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy ) . \nwhen you first see him , your first instinct is that he\'s behind the whole thing . \nthe choice of casting does the film in . \nthen , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him . \nthe only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet . \nso your first instinct has now been confirmed . \nthen , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous \" since we\'re going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing \" moments ) . \nbut earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he\'s told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended . \nhuh ? \nalso , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back . \nso why did he give it up in the first place ? ! \nthe lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? ! \nit\'s totally absurd . . . \nand this is the screenwriter of seven ? \nlate in the film there\'s a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character\'s guns ends up underneath a car . \ncage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table . \njames gandolfini\'s character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of \" suspense \" . \nyou see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he\'s trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching . \ngo around to the other side of the car ! ! \nthis goes on for minutes . \nthen , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car . \nboy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves . \ni think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he\'s seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn ! \nwe actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard . \nother things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that . \nwhenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it . \nawful decision there joel . \nanother is cage\'s performance . \nat this point he\'s capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad . \nfor 8mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he\'s interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case ) . \nyou\'re capable of much better mr . cage . \nnow as for you mr . schumacher . . . \ni\'m starting to doubt if you\'re capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema . \n[r] \n',neg
'there have been bad films in recent years : \'mr . \nmagoo\' was by far the worst ever made , the spectacularly bad \'blue in the face\' , the horrible \'baby genuises\' and now \'i woke up early the day i died\' . \nit may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie . \nthe film\'s acting ( if that\'s what you want to call it ) is well mediocre to me . \nloaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit , boy was i wrong . \nafter escaping from a mental institution \'the thief\' played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty . \nhe turns to burglary to survive , robs a loan back , kills the loan officer and runs with thousands . \na country-wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down . \nhe ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later , comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere . \nnow he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back , ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying . \na film which was based on a \'long-lost\' script by ed wood , i have only one question : no dialogue , only music and movement where exactly is the point ? \nthe film moves along at a rather slow pace , but does have one advantage : the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some . \nit opens with a fun , innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that . \nsome of the low points are when \'the thief\' steals a woman\'s purse , and then she faints , sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom \'the thief\' kills to the music of \'psycho\' . \ncome on people get some new ideas already ! \nwhat\'s even worse is that the film has no plot at all . \nwell to a certain extent it does , but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we\'re bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen . \n\'i woke up early the day i died\' is a perfectly bad film . \nit shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie . \neven with the huge cast talent , the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours . \n',neg
'it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller . \nsome people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may . \nboth those films were tense exercises in chills . \nthe two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer . \nbut that was 1962 and 1964 respectively . \nfor most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed . \neach of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot . \nthey had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay . \nthe thrills all came from the plot . \nronin is like a film made by another man . \nsomewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it . \nwe get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j . d . zeik\'s screenplay is a bit obscure . \nthe film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai . \nwhen a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west . \nif you miss the opening , do not worry . \nthis film will explain again what a ronin is . \nsam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin . \nhe is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer . \nhe clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france . \nsam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case . \ndierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case . \nsam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv\'s richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting ) . \nalso along is larry ( skipp suddeth ) . \nthe group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise . \ntheir only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team . \nthe story is not very easy to follow . \nit is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom . \nsomehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case . \nsome very good actors are involved in this film . \none wonders what they saw in the script . \nthe characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers . \nthey know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed . \nby the end of the film we never really got to know anybody . \nmaybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create . \nin addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal ) . \nas a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy . \nunfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it . \ni rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nnon-spoiler : incidentally , the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times , usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin . \nalso one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet . \nthis is the first blow of the 47 ronin . \n',neg
'in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french-canadian co-production by max fischer . \nthe movie is set in paris where its hero , struggling american author david mirkine ( judd nelson , at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity ) suffers a terrible writers bloc . \nhe manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle ( laurence treill ) . \nunfortunately , she hangs out in jet set circles , which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous . \nher connection with powerful david caravan ( pierce brosnan ) would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events . \nalthough few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller , drama would probably be more appropriate genre label . \npacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers , and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments . \nlow budget also becomes painfully visible , and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film . \nunfortunately , this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes , so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed . \ninstead , they would have to settle with pointless , slow scenes involving nelson , brosnan and laurence treill\'s attempts of serious acting . \nall of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone\'s precious time . \n',neg
'the 13th warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it carries a worst scent than a canine\'s least appetizing residue . \nthe best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector . \nmy vote goes for the ending credits , where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you . \nibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) is an important official who is banished from his home for sleeping with another man\'s wife . \nhe encounters a group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious journey to be taken by 13 men . \nfahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter . \nthe movie proves to be a new low point for banderas , who\'s acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for a dying gay man in 1993\'s philadelphia , than that of a warrior . \nin the film\'s supposed pay off scene , he exclaims \" i was wrong , these are not men ! \" , \na line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production . \nunfortunately , banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes chevy chase\'s career look like oscar material . \nthe film , based on michael crichton\'s best selling novel , eaters of the dead was shot under that name some three years ago , and after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony , but the plot is incredibly difficult to follow . \nat the same time , the 13th warrior makes you think about numerous questions . \nquestions like \" why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark ? \" , \n \" why does no one ever have blood cover both sides of their face , but rather just one side ? \" \nand finally , \" will the manager give me a refund ? \" \n90 minutes into the 103 minute film , a man invites of the warriors \" come with me , there is a woman who can help . \" \nunfortunately , there is nothing that could help this film . \nthe most appropriate ending would have been for the 13 men to join hands , form a chorus line , and break into a rendition of \" springtime for hitler . \" \n',neg

'this is an adaptation of h . g . wells\' acclaimed novel \'the invisible man\' . \nthe actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue . \nthe director is paul verhoven . \nthat , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre . \nthe problem is to keep us there . \ni can\'t imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time . \nworking on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself \" god \" , has discovered the secret to invisibility . \nthe first two faces are completed . \nnow , it is time for \" the next logical step \" -- human . \ncaine volunteers for this risky experiment . \nbut when he is made invisible , something goes wrong . \nwhile his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower . \nbut that\'s not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania . \nhe is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine . \nsoon every sense of decency is forgotten . \nthe little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody . \nthough it\'s based on a novel called \'the invisible man\' , the title has been ironically changed to \'hollow man\' that sums up the film very nicely . \nthis is a very silly production . \nlaughable , actually . \napparently verhoven\'s imagination doesn\'t stretch too far . \nfor him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls\' locker room undetected . \nit is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie . \nbeing invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society . \nin many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences . \nthe nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about . \nall that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat . \ncaine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man . \nbut since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn\'t stop there . \nhe becomes a rapist . \nand then , of course , a murderer . \nyou\'ll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place . \nshue\'s talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent . \nkevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully . \nhis face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice . \nthere are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing . \nin the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place . \nbeing probably the best technical achievement since \" jurassic park \" , they are absolutely amazing . \nwe observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue , and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible . \nwe see a beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly-pumped blood . \nthere are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ? \nwhat is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more . \npretty much like jan de bont ( \" twister \" , \" haunting \" ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary . \nhe was responsible for several good films ( \" basic instinct \" and \" starship troopers ) \" and some incredibly bad films ( \" showgirls \" , \" total recall \" ) , but he has never made anything that was great . \nin a way \" hollow man \" fits perfectly in this collection . \nit\'s not better or worse than verhoven\'s average film . \nhe proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues . \nand so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot\'s of dull action with blood and naked bodies . \nhe even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc , etc . - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year ( you\'ll be screaming \" nooooo ! \" \nand attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion ) . \nand all we can ask is why ? \nthe answer is simple . \nthough hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money . \nit has to be about telling stories , not marketing them . \nit has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness . \nto make us care , to make us think and feel . \nverhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that . \nit\'s all flesh and bones , but no soul . \na void where its imagination should be . \n',neg
'eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights . \nas the movie\'s writer , director , executive producer , and star , murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails . \nbut at the same time , he\'ll receive all of the credit if it succeeds . \nshould you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support murphy\'s risky gamble ? \nwell , that depends on whom you trust more : me or eddie murphy . \nhere\'s what murphy thinks : \" i think the audience is expecting a good time . \nthey gonna get sexy . \nthey gonna get funny . \nthey gonna get drama . \nthey gonna get all of that . \ni think it\'s the best movie i\'ve done \" ( paramount radio network ) . \nhere\'s what i think : harlem nights is charmless , unoriginal , disappointing , and almost without question , the worst film of the actor\'s career ( i haven\'t seen best defense ) . \nand guess who\'s to blame ? ! \nthe movie\'s problem is not murphy\'s direction : harlem nights is a fairly good looking film . \nno , the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled . \nmurphy\'s awful script is the culprit . \nlet\'s count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting : \n ( 1 ) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture . \nyes , he even outdoes his own work in raw . \npractically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word . \nand after 15 minutes , it gets irritating . \n ( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast . \nrichard pryor , redd foxx , michael lerner , and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes . \neach of them shines occasionally , but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle . \n ( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men . \nmurphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life , which is really neither here nor there . \nbut when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 , 000 movie screens across the country , it\'s another matter altogether . \nyou\'re forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff . \nfor instance , murphy punches della reese in the stomach . \nand he shoots jasmine guy in the head . \nthis is a mean-spirited movie , folks ! \nlovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore , but only because she doesn\'t have any scenes with murphy . \nthank god : he might have run her over with a bulldozer . \n ( 4 ) murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date . \nthe loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film . \nmurphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality . \nsometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair . \n ( 5 ) the plot is a shameless rip-off of the sting . \nif you\'re going to make another sting movie , you\'ve got to do something original . \nmurphy\'s tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem ( circa 1938 ) fails to add anything new to the formula . \n ( 6 ) to get laughs , murphy makes fun of stuttering . \nyou know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped . \n ( 7 ) murphy\'s idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life . \nfor what ? \nfor shooting reese\'s little toe off ! \nneedless to say , murphy shows little , if any , promise or imagination as a screenwriter . \nin all fairness , however , a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie . \ndanny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take . \naiello stands out in the large , ensemble cast : he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character ( a racist detective with mob ties ) . \naiello\'s zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice . \nanother bright spot is arsenio hall , who has a hilarious , show-stopping cameo as a cry-baby gangster ; hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy . \nin fact , hall\'s ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie . \nunfortunately , his character is completely irrelevant to the plot ; murphy should have given hall a much bigger role . \nof course , i\'ve already mentioned that i didn\'t care for murphy\'s character , but i have to admit that i did love his neckties . \nthey are simply spectacular--almost worth the price of admission . \n',neg

'since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993\'s steven spielberg drama \" schindler\'s list \" and directed 1993\'s intelligent \" searching for bobby fischer , \" his new film , \" a civil action , \" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . \nwhat doesn\'t make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . \nthe film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . \nbased on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , \" a civil action \" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children\'s death from leukemia due to unknown causes . \njan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families\' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city\'s drinking water . \nsuddenly , after hearing about the families\' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . \nalso figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods\' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case . \ncoming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , \" a civil action \" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . \nperhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . \nwatching the film , i couldn\'t help but notice its similarities with 1997\'s far , far superior film \" the sweet hereafter , \" which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . \nin his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home . \nnot only was the plotting similar to \" a civil action , \" but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . \nconsidering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful \" a sweet hereafter \" was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm\'s character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . \nin \" a civil action , \" however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . \nwe do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . \nthrough its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta\'s lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn\'t appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . \nevery scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . \nyou\'ve got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents\' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what \" a civil action \" does . \nto be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . \naside from one flashback to when a man\'s young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . \ni could say the performances were good , but who\'s fooling who ? \nsince every character is one-dimensionally written , no one\'s acting abilities are challenged in any way . \ntravolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that\'s about all he does . \nduvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets . \nand what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture\'s final scene , as a judge ? \nshe appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ? \nfinally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ? \nabruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , \" a civil action \" seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with . \n',neg

'adam sandler vehicles are never anything special , but continue to make a load of money . \nwhich really goes to show the sad state of cinema today . \nwhile good comedies like rushmore , to choose a recent example , gets limited release and doesn\'t make a lot of money , big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash . \nit\'s also nothing special and doesn\'t deserve the money it\'s making . \nbut i digress . \nsandler plays sonny koufax , a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age . \nhis girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him : either wise up and get responsible , or she\'s leaving him . \nby a strange set of events , koufax ends up with julian ( played by twins cole and dylan sprouse ) a five year old kid . \nafter a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child , koufax decides he wants to keep the child . \nhowever , social worker mr brooks ( mostel ) finds out that koufax isn\'t the real father and wants to take julian back . \nkoufax along with his new girlfriend layla ( lauren adams ) fight to keep the child . \nbig daddy really isn\'t that good . \nmany of the jokes revolve around toilet humour , and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny . \nthere\'s the occasional good one liner , but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour . \nthe film , after all these silly gags , then suddenly turns sentimental , and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous . \nthe court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable , and not helped by the soppy overacting . \nit\'s a poor attempt to win over the audience . \nadam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films ( except the wedding singer . ) \njoey lauren adams is much , much better , and deserves a far better film than this trash . \nsteve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo , and his scenes are pretty funny . \nrob schneider is also funny as a crazy delivery man . \nthe two twins who play julian are o . k , they start out rather well , but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn \'all american\' wholesome goodness at the end of the film , where the tear juice is turned up high . \nbig daddy is really nothing special , and is not even worth it for a few chuckles . \nalthough it is actually well put together , with nice direction , good production design and even some montages , this professionalism can\'t help the fact that the script and characters are trash . \nbig daddy is for die hard fans of sandler , and that\'s about it . \n',neg
'the happy bastard\'s quick movie review \nwild wild west \na better name for this movie might\'ve been \" wild wild waste \" . \nwarner bros . , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib\'s success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big-screen update to the classic western/sci-fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad . \nbut somehow , they ran into a problem along the way . \nthey were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would\'ve made all the difference- a story writer . \nwild wild west\'s story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon . \nif warner bros . had gotten him , the movie would\'ve possibly been five times better than what it is . \nheck , ten times . \nas is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he\'s performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well . \nhere\'s the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam-controlled wheelchair . \nthey catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path . \nas i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess . \nbut the acting doesn\'t help either . \nkevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado . \nsmith seems to be having a better time as west , although he\'s not nearly as charming as he was in mib . \nbranagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can\'t even stand to look at him or his strange beard . \nand salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention . \nher acting is barely passable , but what a \" breath of fresh ass \" . \ndirector barry sonnenfeld isn\'t of great help either . \neven though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost . \nit\'s as if he feels he\'s directing a tv movie , a big no-no when you\'re helming what\'s supposed to be a big-screen hit . \nlast but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable . \nat one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline\'s train . \nhe jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it\'s still in motion ! \nalso , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks . \nlast but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he\'s not kissing a woman as he\'s looking through a peephole at the enemy ? ! \nthe only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects . \nthe huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show . \nthere\'s also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity . \ni would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really isn\'t possible . \nif the racist and sex jokes don\'t bother you , the performances will . \nif the performances don\'t bother you , the story will . \nif the story doesn\'t bother you , the racist and sex jokes will . \nthere\'s no end to the vicious circle . \ngo rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats . \nyou\'ll have a better time . \nif you do go , keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant . \ni bet he wishes he were somewhere else . . . \n',neg

'synopsis : a man whose lover , paris , was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system . \nthe subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend , laura , and becomes addicted to virtual reality , which , due to a design flaw in his unit , recreates the dead paris . \ncomments : virtual seduction , executive produced by roger corman and lance h . robbins , serves as a cheaply-made precursor to strange days , a far superior film . \nboth movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ( ab ) using technology to be with former lovers ( in strange days , the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality ) . \ninterestingly , both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium , though strange days uses the setting far more effectively . \nthis exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction . \nit\'s not bad for what it is : low-budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality . \nunfortunately , it\'s been done before and since in much better films , a fact which ultimately leaves the sci-fi fan bored by this movie . \nvirtual seduction has many faults ( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins ) . \nthe film\'s script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first , but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy-handed and wooden as the movie progresses . \nmany important scenes seem too dark ; the lighting could have been improved significantly . \nthe cast , a collection of veteran b-movie actors and sitcom regulars , do only a mediocre job in their roles . \njeff fahey , of the original lawnmower man , convincingly , though unenergetically , plays the lead character . \ncarrie genzel plays paris , the vr lover , but ami dolenz , as the current love interest , seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality , which doesn\'t lend credence to the film\'s premise . \nmeschach taylor , of the once popular designing women sitcom , adequately plays a scientist working on the project , but his performance isn\'t something to write home about either . \nvirtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background . \nin other words , one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then , but it\'s rather boring to just sit and watch . \nthe movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from b-movies in this genre , but it is still an adult r-rated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt . \nthis turkey , ultimately , isn\'t awful , but it\'s not particularly interesting or unique either . \ndon\'t be seduced into watching this movie unless you\'ve got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch . \n',neg
'i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner  and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws . \nbut if you ask me , the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american . \nor more the point , anyone that allows him to bask in his own less-than-subtle presence . \nthis is not an insult to gere , as i consider him to be a rather talented actor  but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role . \nif a film is solely about one person , the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work . \nalthough geres performance is in no way poorly acted , it is far from perfect  and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself . \nthis is where he truly belongs , and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear ( with the sensational edward norton ) , the jackal ( with bruce willis ) and pretty woman ( with the delightful julia roberts ) . \nin red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore , who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear  bold and up front , who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind . \nit is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed , which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail . \nit doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm to work on a pretty chinese lady , and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room  drunk and cheerful . \nyet instead of a hangover , poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on a couch . \nhe is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison . \nhis cell , food and rights  all terrible . \nnow trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy , lawyer shen yuelin ( bai ling ) defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder . \njack and shen argue about their countries different laws ; shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family .  \nas the plot thickens , scenes get progressively more ridiculous  ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected but-you-knew-along criminal is discovered . \nred corner is one of those films where you sneer , laugh or vomit youre way through all of its minutes . \nwhat should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act . \nthis is not to say that the film does not have its moments  there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created  telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption . \nbut what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place  perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch . \nif you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly , the basic idea is quite tangible . \nit is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing , the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before . \nif that wasnt bad enough , red corners dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions . \nshen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father , whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself . \ntaking itself far too seriously , red corner is not half the film it intends to be . \nalthough it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast , the films main fault is in the bizarre ( and often out of place ) way of unfolding a story which isnt that meritorious anyway . \nwhilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor , i would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a serious yet hollow drama again . \nmartin vailwhere are you ? \n',neg

'can a horror movie truly be called a horror movie if it has no scares , suspense , or even eerie elements ? \ni think not , but that\'s what children of the corn 666 : issac\'s return wants us to believe . \nthe sixth installment in the horrible , worn out series is by far the worst to date . \nunlike the other five chapters , children of the corn 666 is a confusing , brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror , but either way , none of these movies are the least bit scary . \nthe film follows hannah ( natalie ramsey ) a teen looking for her mother in gatlin , nebraska , on the eve of her 21st birthday . \nwhat starts out as a daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn , who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder . \nthat\'s about all that\'s understandable in the film , as after we learn this much , issac ( john franklin ) who led the children of the corn in a previous chapter , now an older , strange man , is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy . \nand this is supposed to make sense . \nreally . \nfrom the start the film is unclear of where its going , not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table , constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality , and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film . \nthe film runs at a short 78 minutes , but it seems to be more in the vicinity of two hours , as the bleak , slow pacing makes children of the corn 666 : issac\'s return excruciatingly boring . \nplot holes are everywhere in tim sulka and john franklin\'s unbelievably horrible script , as nothing is accomplished or clear when the film reaches its conclusion . \neveryone and everything involved with children of the corn 666 : issac\'s return , namely writers john franklin and tim sulka , along with director kari skogland , should crawl under a rock , and hope no one sees their horrible work of trash . \nthe bottom line : horrible , horrible , horrible . \nanother attempt to revive this worn out genre falls flat . \nand what\'s with that title ? \nthe devil has nothing to do whatsoever with this film . \nlet\'s pray that this is the finale in one of the worst current film series . \none of the worst horror films in years . \n',neg

'capsule : this super-light situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems . \nthe script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not a lot different from what is shown free on television . \nthe characters are paper-thin and the interesting ideas purely non-existent . \nthis is a decrement-life-by-90-minutes card . \n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \njalla ! jalla ! \nis basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen . \nit tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love . \nthe film is set in sweden where roro and mans ( fares fares and torkel petersson ) are custodians at a public park . roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely , mans is a swede from a much more liberal background . \nthey spend most of the day in the bushes at their park , cleaning up after dogs . \nroro and mans each have girlfriends , but each has a problem . \nroro ( nicknamed \" jalla \" ) is having family problems . \nit seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman , yasmin ( laleh pourkarim ) , but he is already in love with lisa ( tuva novotny ) . \nyasmin likes roro , but does not want to get married either . \nmans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence . \nthe two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other . \nmans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers . \nthe one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them . \nroro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other , but then plan to break up before the wedding . \nnot too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected . \nthe plot turns in several places are contrived . \none knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen . \nlebanese-born josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer . \nwhen things start to get slow , he just adds throws in another story . \nfor example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film . \ncharacterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function . \nwe do see some of roro\'s family life and his concerns . \nthat may be because roro\'s background is a lot like that of the director . \nwhile the story was entertaining , i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile from the film . \nit was just a way to pass about an hour and a half in my life . \none does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this . \ni rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n',neg
'despite its exceedingly well-done visual effects , 1995\'s original species was one big hunk of sci-fi cheese , from the writing to the feeble performances . \nso , coming from such b-grade roots , its sequel\'s stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising , yet at the same time it is . \nit would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original , yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad , if not even worse . \nsomething is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in species--a sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alien/human hybrid sil--is never entered into ( perhaps that was left for species iii--though i\'m not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own ) . \nthe alien fun and games begin this time when a three-person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain , patrick ross ( justin lazard , late of cbs\'s short-lived soap of a few years back , central park west/cpw ) . \nthis alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film\'s sil , but it\'s close enough , and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy , engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find . \nmeanwhile , scientist dr . laura baker ( the returning marg helgenberger ) has created a clone of sil named eve ( natasha henstridge again ) for research purposes . \nit doesn\'t take long for eve to sense another alien presence , which send her libido into hyperdrive . \nit\'s up to laura and her former partner , bounty hunter press lennox ( michael madsen , another returnee ) ; and patrick\'s uninfected shipmate dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) to find patrick before the in-heat eve does . \n \" this isn\'t the x-files , goddammit ! \" \nexclaims one character in the early going . \nin terms of quality , he\'s absolutely right , but he\'s also wrong . \nthe new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick\'s pupils to dilate once he\'s infected . \nlooks and sounds an awful lot like the x-files\'s \" black cancer \" to me . \nbut that\'s not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from . \nspecies was already a ripoff of alien , but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original\'s director , roger donaldson , did . \nhuman patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself , and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve\'s alien body ( which ironically was designed by alien designer h . r . giger ) . \na large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns ? \naliens sans flamethrowers . \nthe visual effects were by far the best thing about species , and the sequel\'s effects crew at steve johnson\'s xfx inc . keeps that high-quality tradition alive ; no cheap-looking lost in space cgi here . \nafter the effects , the original\'s best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge . \nhowever , medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment . \nat one point she\'s called on to play alien \" empath \" ? la forest whitaker in the original , but for most of the duration she\'s holed up in a glass cell . \nby the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place , the film is well into its home stretch . \nso the rest of the time we are treated to patrick , played with little zest by lazard . \none problem with the first film was that the deadly , horny , but innocent-at-heart sil was too sympathetic ; no such problem with patrick , who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control . \nthe rest of the cast also fails to add much , but the writing can be faulted for that . \nhelgenberger and madsen go through the motions , but they are already hampered by the clich ? d development that somewhere between the two films , the once-linked laura and press stopped getting along . \nwilliamson suffers the worst indignity . \nhe tries his best to enliven the token african-american role , but how can anyone recite insulting , derivative lines such as \" i\'m gonna get african on someone\'s ass \" and not appear ridiculous ? \nbut species ii\'s worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work . \nat least the original featured plenty to laugh at--unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker , and the sight of helgenberger\'s character performing fellatio on madsen\'s , for a start . \nbut the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all , let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level . \nfor all the blood and gore , nudity , and sex thrown in , species ii is , quite simply , a vapid bore . \n',neg
'from a major league baseball radio broadcast , featuring play-by- play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown , with special guest commentator james berardinelli . \nhc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we\'re joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who\'s here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors . \nnice to see you , jim . \nas a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? \njb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago . \none entry was definitely enough , and i\'m surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 . this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video . \nit\'s worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature . \ni should also mention that this movie likely won\'t play all that well in cleveland . \nnow that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks . \nactually , most of the action involves the twins\' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise . \nhc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field . \nleading off this inning is john warren . \nhe steps into the batter\'s box and takes kent\'s pitch low for ball one . \nwh : so , the story\'s strictly minor league , right ? \nwhat\'s it about ? \njb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell . \nwhen twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to \" the show . \" \nwith the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track . \nin fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley ) . \nsoon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus\' overachieving group against huff\'s overpaid , last-place bunch . \nwh : can we guess who wins ? \njb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you\'ve already seen the box score . \non top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair . \nthey\'re not just boring ; they\'re lackluster . \nbut the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they\'ve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs . \nhc : warren fouls off a fastball . \n1 and 1 . \nwh : are there lots of yuks in this one ? \njb : not one , from start to finish . \ni enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny . \nokay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh . \nthe two sequels haven\'t just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low . \neven bob uecker\'s once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they\'re the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing . \nhc : here\'s the 1-1 pitch . \nlooooooong drive ? fair or foul ? foul ball ! \nthe count goes to 1 and 2 . \nwh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ? \njb : yes . \nthere aren\'t any glaring errors like there were in one of the best-ever baseball movies , the natural . \nbut i\'d gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor . \nheck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors . \nwh : it\'s nice to see old friends one more time , isn\'t it ? \nlike cerrano , tanaka , and dorn . \njb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back . \nthere aren\'t any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs . \nyeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can\'t throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ? \nthey have no depth . \nnotable absences include tom berenger\'s veteran and charlie sheen\'s \" wild thing . \" \nwe don\'t really miss them , though . \nhc : breaking ball , low and outside . \n2 and 2 . \nwh : so you\'re saying that we should give this one a miss ?

' \" deep rising \" gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films . \nwhile dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring\'s \" anaconda \" -- \" deep rising \" has no tongue to put in its cheek . \nfolks , we\'re only a month into the new year , and already here\'s a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases . \nmost of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh-oh -- if these people had seen \" titanic , \" then maybe they\'d have known to stay home ) when it\'s attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature . \nthe only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke janssen ) , argonautica owner canton ( anthony heald ) and a few other crew members . \na mercenary team , lead by resourceful captain john finnegan ( treat williams ) , board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby . \nbut what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood-soaked , hungry and not very helpful . \nthe main problem with \" deep rising \" is its overt familiarity ; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in recent memory . \nthe concept is \" leviathan \" meets \" titanic , \" with a dash of \" speed 2 \" thrown in for good ( or is that bad ? ) \nmeasure . \nthis monster is equal parts \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" and \" the relic , \" knows how to open doors like the raptors from \" jurassic park \" and even gets to expel a half-digested victim ( a neat effect , admittedly ) a la the giant snake in \" anaconda . \" \nsome of the attack sequences are straight out of \" jaws \" and \" alien . \" \na scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of \" alien resurrection . \" \nthere\'s even a jet ski chase like \" hard rain . \" \nand the list goes on . \nwatching \" deep rising \" \'s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself , because none of them have well-developed characters , nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy . \nwilliams is affable enough , but his finnegan just isn\'t believable . \nan interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted ; pretty famke janssen , best known as \" goldeneye \" \'s killer thighs , is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams , while kevin j . o\'connor , as finnegan\'s mechanic , provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast . \ndjimon honsou , who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december\'s \" amistad , \" pops up in a brief part . \nhe needs to stay away from the water . \nthe movie\'s final shot is a groaner , as is the 11th-hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on-ship saboteur . \nas if a cast deserving of their snack food-fate isn\'t bad enough ( when you taunt the monster , you\'re really asking for it ) , \" deep rising \" is a slow , stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot . \nand since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is , the closer we are to the end of the movie , rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn\'t out of the question . \n',neg
'the catch phrase for disney\'s rocket man is one spoken by fred z . randall ( harland williams ) , the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes . \n \" it wasn\'t me ! \" he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others . \nwell when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is , williams can\'t take all the blame , but he sure can\'t justify himself with his own simple tag line either . \nfred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy , turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide-eyed at a poster of the earth . \nas a 30-year-old , fred hasn\'t grown up much , but at least he\'s somewhat closer to his goal , now designing astronaut software for nasa . \nwhen an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured , nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void . \n . \n . \nfred . \nyes , although he\'s an obviously klutzy moron , nasa doesn\'t think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program , and time itself , has ever known . \nfor the first part of the film , we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park . he laughs , he screams , but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child\'s play . \nhis passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record-breaking feats , much to the dismay of cocky counterpart , mission commander captain overbeck ( william sadler ) , who once held the records . \noverbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet , one being astronaut julie ford ( the stupids\' jessica lundy ) , and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist . \nfrom here on out , we are subjected to one lame gag after another , dealing with snot , laxatives , and flatulence . \nyou know , standard kid movie material . \nalmost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist , williams is awful in his first starring role . \nwe get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee-wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring , williams would be it . \nwhile he\'s not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany , stupid comedy , he\'s just as unlikeable . \nto say it more understandably , jim carrey might annoy you more , but this guy is even less funny . \nwhy ? \nbecause while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role , his performance is too understated and boring . \nclassic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy . \nstan laurel , for example , was so innocent in all his trouble-making that we were immediately fond of him . \npeter sellers , as inspector clouseau , was so self-assured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip , it was humor at it\'s best . \nwilliams , on the other hand , can\'t garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his anti-glory . \nas for the rest of the cast , including some bigger names in smaller roles ( beau bridges and shelley duvall ) , nobody is worth watching whatsoever . \nthis is just another example of the fast-food equivalent of cinema : mass-produced , less than mediocre , over priced , and hard to stomach . \ngiving it one-and-a-half stars is * extremely * generous , but even i\'ll admit to laughing a few times . \nthe amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids , laughter was something rarely heard - even from the children ! \ni must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didn\'t crack up over every little thing . \nthen again , maybe they were asleep . \nsome people might think critics are harsh on kid movies , claiming adults aren\'t the targeted audience and therefore aren\'t meant to , and won\'t , enjoy them . \nsadly , it\'s also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it\'s presented right . \na two-hour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there , but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast , which could easily do the same thing ? \nand saying that a parent\'s perspective isn\'t important is quite a poor theory to have when they\'re the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place . \n',neg

'phaedra cinema , the distributor of such never-heard-of classics as \" soft toilet seats , \" \" trailer : the movie , \" and \" the one armed boxer vs . the flying guillotine , \" has sneaked its latest release , \" the sculptress , \" into a few theaters this weekend hoping to cash in on a handful of halloween holidaygoers looking for a right good scare . \n \" the sculptress \" is a scary proposition all right , but not in the way its producers intended . \nfrom the outset it\'s easy to see why some of the larger , more reputable chains aren\'t carrying it : the film looks like a straight-to-video release from the early \'80s that\'s been dusted off ( not very carefully ) and re-issued in theatrical format . \nthat staple of schlocky z-movies jeff fahey ( \" the lawnmower man \" ) plays a washed-up shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills . \nwhen he\'s not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment , screaming scotch-induced \" hamlet \" soliloquies well into the night , he\'s out and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women . \nfahey\'s dobie sizes up his victims ( actually just one , a peep show performer name of sylvie ) dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk , and approaches them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane , dark glasses , and a false beard ( just in time for halloween ! ) . \n \" do you have a castle ? \" \nsylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop . \n \" jah . \nwith ze many turrets \" is dobie\'s perplexing reply . \nthe real \" star \" of the film ( and i use that term extremely loosely ) is katie wright , who plays the sculptress of the title . \nsarah is new in town , studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a \" genius \" frenchman , played by the beret-wearing patrick bauchau . \nthat\'s convenient , because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris ( you won\'t believe the film\'s final shot , with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop and \" rosemary\'s baby \" -inspired imagery ) . \nbauchau\'s character criticizes sarah\'s work publicly ( her clay busts keep turning into gargoyles--perhaps she\'s possessed . . . \nby an incubus ! ! ? ) but he still manages to talk her into dinner . \nwhereas wright does a decent english accent , her talents pretty much end there . \non the other side of the wall , dobie\'s troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene in which he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like \" actor delivers a stunning macbeth , \" actor courted by hollywood studio , \" \" actor renounces hollywood for priesthood , \" and \" prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal . \" \nthe film\'s plot could have been just as easily condensed . \n \" artist moves in next door to shakespearean psychopath . \" \n \" yawns ensue . \" \nso dobie rants and raves and sarah chips away at large blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes . \nlate in the film , their paths finally cross with mind-numbing results . \nnobody else in the apartment complex appears to mind all the racket , but one old dear does go ballistic when sarah\'s bathtub overflows . \nno , we don\'t see wright in the tub ( or fahey for that matter ) , and the gore quotient is virtually nil , so for a horror film \" the sculptress \" is surprisingly lacking . \nthe only thing worth looking at is san francisco , and writer/director ian merrick manages to make even it look dreary , windswept , and deserted . \n \" the sculptress \" isn\'t even bad enough to be fun . \nluckily , a limited release has made it easy to avoid . \n',neg
'i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard . \nthe problem is , i can\'t remember them as i write this review . \nthat\'s not a good sign . \nin booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can\'t really describe , because i don\'t know that much about him . \ni only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn\'t like relationships , just \" booty calls \" at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment ) . \nbunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz\'s direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! ) . \nrushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it\'s going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki\'s friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) , who have never met . \nto make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki\'s obsession with safe sex . \nfirst she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them . \noh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin . \nback to the store . \nnow they\'ve got to get dental dams , or there\'ll be no foreplay . \nwhy are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ? \nnikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she\'d better be making these demands , too . \ntalk about coitus interruptus . \nbooty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies . \nthe difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality . \nin this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane ! \nat the extreme . \nthere are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention . \nit is disappointing , and even worse , distracting . \nthere are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? ) \ndoes not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing . \nfor instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant . \nbunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone\'s surprise . \nhowever , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery . \nthis negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene . \nif , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , \" kung-fu movies , \" and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective . \nthis is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable . \nby explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit . \nthe inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions . \nwhy are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ? \nwhy do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ? \nif nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn\'t she have some condoms at her own apartment ? \nthese questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward . \na very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language . \nsome movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character\'s pattern of speech . \nother films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves . \nbooty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it doesn\'t work . \nthey stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them . \nhalf of the scenes seem to occur for no reason . \nthe chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler . \nthis is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long . \nit\'s too bad that the core of the film isn\'t much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog . \ni refer you to the first paragraph of this review . \n',neg
'the word to describe sharon stone is \" wonder \" . \nnot that she _is_ a wonder , but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent . \nshe has a dynamic screen presence in \" basic instinct \" , turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in \" casino \" , but possesses neither of those here . \nstone teams up with private school headmaster\'s wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani\'s thoroughly unlikable husband ( chazz palminteri ) . \nin a comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock ( as in `homage to\' [read \" steal from \" ] ) , it turns out that someone saw them or he\'s not dead or maybe . . . \nkathy bates turns in a credible , if unspectacular , performance as an investigative police detective . \nher character is a bit dull but realistic , although her actions at the end are puzzling . \nadjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation . \nit\'s stone that is a disappointment among the actors . \nhow can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one ? \ncostumed in skin-tight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone , she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring , not enticingly dangerous . \neven the threat ( or promise ? ) of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out . \non the positive side , there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive . \nthat is if you can put up with stone\'s cardboard cut-out character and scenes directly lifted from hitch\'s movies . \n',neg
'the tagline on random hearts reads \" in a perfect world , they never would have met . \" \nin a perfect world , i never would have seen this movie . \nthe biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film , kay chandler ( kristin scott thomas ) and dutch van den broeck ( harrison ford ) are the only two major characters alive ; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some production . \ndutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department . \nkay is a congresswoman from new hampshire . \nalthough they both think they are happily married , their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs . \ndutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners ; they subsequently discover the affair . \nthe rest of the film is the pointless , unrealistic and often-times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to , and getting to know each other in the process . \ntwo sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film . \ndutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer , a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare . \nall the great stereotypes get pulled , including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter . \nkay\'s distraction from the film\'s primary focus is her campaign for re-election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal . \nthese sub plots could have made for semi-interesting points , but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother-daughter relations in depth , and consequently suffers . \nrandom hearts\' two primary characters seem to live in shells . \nalthough both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots , they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other . \nthere is plenty of opportunity , dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter , but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships . \nveteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack , and critically acclaimed up-and-comer dylan baker both have cameo roles , but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both . \nother than its weak plot , it is hard to criticize random hearts . \nhowever , it is also hard to compliment it . \nhad the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake , rather than the dry one that equates to be . \n',neg
'arriving in a barrage of hype , the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year . \nhowever , like the golden child , although blair witch has made a lot of money , it\'s not very good . \ndonahue , williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth . \nthe film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded , which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles . \nalthough events start of normal , they get weird pretty quickly , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on . \nalthough an interesting premise , the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity . \nthe biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise . \nmost of the dialogue is ad-libbed , and still manages to sound like a poor b-movie . \nthe \'script\' eventually degenerates into shouting matches , with the f-word included a lot to sound like students . \nthere are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur , but then it\'s back to the shouting and swearing , which gets very tiresome very quickly . \nif i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods , shout a lot and swear , i\'d go on scout camp . \nbut no , the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this , but i\'m not quite sure how . \nthe supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting , especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes . \nwith no music and no budget to work with , the film has to depend on natural , psychological scares , which are sometimes well delivered , sometimes not . \ni never really felt truly scared during any part of the film , although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film . \nhowever , because the actors are so irritating , the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying \'what the f * ck is that ? \' \na lot , and mike giggling like a loony . \nthere\'s also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things . \nthe main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment , and are hopelessly lost , heather still insists on filming it all . \nthe film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this , but it isn\'t very convincing . \nalso , the students have no idea how to survive in the woods , such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation . \nthere are also some parts where the \'amateur\' camcorder footage is obviously staged , heather\'s apology being a major one . \nthe blair witch project , in the end , just fails to deliver . \ni suppose if you\'ve been lost camping before , the film may deliver some chills , but this is no use for the other 99\% of the paying audience who haven\'t been lost in the woods . \napart from the final minutes , the film is mind boggingly unscary , and the shouting matches get hideously dull . \nthe spook scenes are short and far between , and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide . \nalthough a good idea , it\'s not executed well enough to be a fun , scary cinema experience . \nit\'s a worrying fact when the website ( http : //www . blairwitch . com \n ) is better than the film . \n',neg

\nwrong . \napparently , someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot . \n ( this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood . ) \nso , the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life , rather , it\'s a voice-over narration by the aforementioned doctor ( keifer sutherland ) explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible . \nit\'s as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca . \nno , wait , that\'s not fair to casablanca . \nit\'s more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show -- or if you want to know how i really feel , having an off-screen narrator explain that gilligan won\'t be getting off the island in this episode . \n>from here , the coherence of the plot goes down faster than ( insert monica lewinsky joke here ) . \nthe characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason , and that\'s what moves the plot . \nwhat we\'re left with is a string of unanswered questions that don\'t make any sense . \nwe\'re given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers , yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed . \nwe\'re given a hero who can \" tune \" into these same powers , yet he only uses them when it\'s convenient to the plot . \nwe\'re given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere \nusually , critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part \" isn\'t given much to do . \" \nin this movie , no one is given anything to do . \nsewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesn\'t remember anything , and plays it like . . . \num . . . \na man who doesn\'t remember anything . \nthe aliens are tall , pasty-faced , and bald , and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they\'re evil -- and there\'s a child alien as well , straight out of an anne rice novel . \nsutherland is saddled with a limp , a twitchy eye , and a breathy accent to remind us that he\'s in league with the aliens . \nto its credit , dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting . \nwilliam hurt is perfectly cast as the world-weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city . \njennifer connelly , playing sewell\'s love interest , is given two all-too-brief moments on screen as a lounge singer -- and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit . \nbut instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script ( the way they would be in any self-respecting noir movie ) they\'re almost tangiential to the plot , such as it is . \nthe problem with dark city is this : it\'s a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir . \nthe essence of film noir isn\'t , as proyas seems to beleive , breathy dialogue or snap-brim fedoras or tall , bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner . \ndark city has not one bit of intrigue , moral ambiguity , suspense , or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics . \ndark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic . \nit\'s an exceptionlly well-made and intricately designed piece of flotsam , sailing around and around the middle of the ocean , going nowhere . \n',neg
'you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year . \nthey\'re obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes ( having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big box-office holiday season ) . \ncombine that with howie long\'s first starring action role , and you\'ve got a doozy of a movie that , while not as bad as it could have been , isn\'t a very good film . \nhowie stars as an ace smokejumper ( a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground ) . \nin the slightly contrived opening scenes , we witness his heroism in action , as he , and his mentor ( played by scott glenn ) attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire . \nwilliam forsythe plays the bad guy , a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak . \nhe ( and five convict cohorts ) manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby . \nhis escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards , but ( since there must be a movie ) luck is with him . \nsoon the now-escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters . \nwhy canadian ? \nwho knows , eh ? \nalong the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher ( suzy amis ) to be their hostage . \nenter howie long . \nhe\'s called in to help fight the blaze , and when he spots the group of \" ground pounders \" , apparently lost , he parachutes in to help . \nwhen he discovers their true identity , he is the only thing standing between them and escape , and the only hope of help for the hostage . \nlong\'s acting talents are above those of , say , steven seagal , but not by much . \nalthough his delivery is mostly flat and wooden , he\'s a likeable hero , and there are some hints here and there that he may get better . \nthe script doesn\'t help him out any , however . \nall too often , it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny . \nthe dialogue is strictly b-movie material , and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable . \nlong\'s co-stars are a mixed bag . \nat least they\'re all comfortable in their respective roles . \nforsythe has the scenery-chewing villain down cold , down cold , and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch , even when he doesn\'t seem to be stretching his talents ( as is definitely the case here ) . \nsuzy amis plays peril pretty well , but isn\'t given much more to do . \nsome of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting , but many are rather bland . \nyou\'d think that the director , dean semler , a former cinematographer , would at least produce a film with interesting visuals . \nthat\'s not the case . \nthere\'s a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences . . . we\'ve \nseen this stuff before . \nit\'s not the most auspicious start to 1998 , but it could have been worse ( just think back to 1996\'s debut , bio-dome ) . \nhowever , after a month of oscar-caliber pictures , a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were . \nin fact , there\'s a good chance that some of them are still playing near you . . . \n',neg

'i didn\'t hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film . \nfor the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored . \ni found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it\'s entertaining to watch it in the same way that it\'s entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl . \nas a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries . \nit reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways . \nit\'s fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they\'re doing . \nunfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don\'t seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy . \nthe biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place . \nbut it sure is a fascinating failure . \nmarky . \n . \n . \ner , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman . \nhe\'s a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn\'t snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything ) . \nhe works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) . \nthey\'re a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex . \nthey all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen . \nit is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in . \nthey decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father . \nwhen they do this , it turns out she is paris\' . \n . \n . \ngoddaughter ! \nit\'s very bad to have paris against you . \nthe story is standard action film stuff . \nit\'s nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) . \nclearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it\'s a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy . \nit\'s true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) . \nthere are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story . \nthey use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns . \nmelvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives . \nlike i said , it\'s not boring ; most disasters aren\'t . \nwhat makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness . \nit seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains . \nthen , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere . \nthen , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy . \nkeiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . \nand scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all . \none of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator . \nthe scene is played for laughs , but it isn\'t funny . \nand since it doesn\'t quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails . \nthis is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun . \ncars land on tree branches and are supported by them . \ncharacters betray each other without a second thought . \ngrenades are thrown in tight places . \npeople jump out of tall buildings and survive . \npeople outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds . \nmost frustrating of all , though , is the film\'s definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals . \nthey\'re more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand-held machineguns ) . \nthe characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn\'t make for deep or interesting people to watch . \nthe acting is kind of fun , though--wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way . \nphillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin\'s fianc ? e , is convincingly air-headed . \nthe big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny . \nthe funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one-liners . \nit\'s a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional . \ndespite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here . \nyou can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . \nif you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself . \n',neg
'saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night , and i have to say i wasn\'t too impressed . \nthis film is about an expert marine sniper , played by tom berenger , who is teamed with a hot-shot-young-no-experience-never-killed-a-man new partner to take out some drug-kingpins and military strong men in panama . \nsound cliche ? \nthat\'s only the beginning . \nbilly zane ( memphis belle ) played the rookie , and never seemed to get a handle on his character . \nhe was so contrary and pig-headed in the beginning , you just wanted to smack him . \nthen he goes \" crazy \" from the pressure , but seems to immediately snap out of it . \ni\'m not sure if the blame should lie with the directing , editing , scriptwriting , or acting . . . \nbut it didn\'t all come together . \ni think berenger is a pretty good actor , and he looked great in the part , covered in camo , face painted , stalking through the jungle with his high-power rifle . . . \nbut once again , his character was given some pretty bad dialogue , and didn\'t react too logically to many of the situations . \nthere was very little logical development in these characters . \nmy biggest problem with this film was it\'s tendency to put these two snipers in as * many * inches-from-death situations as possible . \nthey began to resemble g . i . joes , the greatest american hero . \nand of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls . \nnow a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold , in fact that\'s what made die hard so much fun : the super-hero avenger type . \nso some will enjoy the action hero heroics , but i didn\'t think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes , and the \" real life \" feel of covert operations in panama . \na word must be said on the camera work , much of it was very nice . \nthe jungles of panama ( or their stand-ins in this case ) formed a very picturesque background . . . \nand the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography . \nmany have seen the slowed down \" bullet-cam \" following the projectile to its target . \nthis was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill . \nit was dramatic when used in flashback . . . but \nit seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots ( pardon the pun ) into the real time action . . . then \nit just seemed silly . \nall in all , not a real dog : there is some nice action , good atmosphere , and pretty photography . \nbut the plot is pretty lame , the acting didn\'t form a cohesive whole , and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics . \n',neg

'i have never been so confused after watching a movie . \n \" meet joe black \" is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year , with a cinematography , music and cast that will dazzle most of us . \nat the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season . \nat first you marvel at the elegant direction , graceful cinematography and sensual musical score . \nthen you\'ll wait for something to happen for half an hour , but when you finally understand what\'s going on , you\'ll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins , brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this ? \nthe script is simply a silly and unresolved story , which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture . \nit feels like an eternity . \nmost of the time it is a pompous soap opera , filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and \" meaningful \" winks . \nthe film is based on alberto caesella\'s play \" death takes a holiday \" . \nthe story concentrates around bill ( anthony hopkins ) who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man , but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying \" yes \" . \nsoon he meets a young elegant gentlemen ( brad pitt ) who introduces himself as \" death \" . \nit is bill\'s time . \nbut death has other plans . \nit has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive . \nour bill is chosen to be death\'s guide and in exchange he gets time . \nbill introduces death as joe black , who immediately becomes the center of everyone\'s attention . \nbill\'s business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill\'s side , lives in his house and resides at his office . \nthat is not all , however . \nbill\'s youngest daughter susan ( claire forlani ) falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her . \nthis relationship is bound to have some serious consequences . \nit wouldn\'t be fair to say that this film didn\'t have some interesting moments , such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill\'s family for dinner . \nwhen joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love , the experience is somewhat different . \nit is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure . \nit\'s one thing to say : \" wouldn\'t it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth . . \" \nto create a motion picture out of this is another . \nfour screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic . \nit is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film . \non the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest ( \" scent of a woman \" ) . \nhopkins looks great in any role , and no matter how shallow or hollow it is , he will complete it . \nhis talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else , since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment . \nbut pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time . \nhow can you play death in human form ? \nto me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters . \nthey are not creatures , but phenomenas . \nsaying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form . \nhandling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work . \nspeaking in a calm , soft voice , portraying death as a lonely , distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters . \nhe looks and acts more like an angel of death , rather than a demon or a red-eyed executioner . \nclaire forlani and others are also fine , stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits . \nunfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery . \nin other words this is not what i expected from the director of \" scent of a woman \" . \nit could ( and should ) be better with such cast and crew . \nin the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera . \n',neg
'well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task . \nhe has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films . \nin a domain that he owns , it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script from a bad one . \neraser , back in 1996 , was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense . \nbatman and robin , in 1997 , was the black sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting , idiotic action scenes , and painfully flashy costumes . \nnow in 1999 , \" end of days \" ( not \" the end of days \" ) is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold . \nis this the end of a powerful action star\'s long-lived career ? \nwill arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past ( \" terminator \" , \" terminator 2 : judgement day \" , \" predator \" ) ? \nor an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in the past ( \" commando \" , \" red sonja \" , \" true lies \" ) ? \nit doesn\'t look that way . \n \" end of days \" begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably , due to the formation of the stars on that night , will be the carrier of satan\'s baby the hour before new year\'s of 2000 . \nfortunately for the movie\'s sake , the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers , subway trains in dark tunnels , and a myriad of inept nypd officers . \nit\'s an action film\'s dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up . \nimagine if the girl had lived in anytown , usa , where the only thing to destroy is a dairy queen and a post office . \narnold schwarzenegger ( jericho cane ) , in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church , who is trying to hide the girl ( or in some cases trying to kill her ) , and satan ( gabriel byrne ) who is trying to make her pregnant . \nif the devil is successful , the world will no longer exist as we know it . \njericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1 ) he once had faith but no longer does and 2 ) his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it . \njericho cane is your cliched , by-the-numbers hero right up to his name . \narnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can . \nhe shouts at everyone , from cops to priests , to the devil . \nin one truly hilarious scene , which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point , jericho screams to the devil ; \" you are a @#$^\% ! & \nchoir boy ! \nyou are a choir boy ! \" \nthose two lines marked the high points of this film . \na movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor . \n \" end of days \" fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne . \nbyrne , playing a man who has been made the manifestation of the devil , seems to be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie . \nhe wonderfully plays a manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time . \nthe annoying thing about his character , however , is that he has the power to kill any human with a simple punch in the face , yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho . \ni can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody . \nthe other actors in the film give very weak and unconvincing performances . \nkevin pollak , who plays the partner and close friend of jericho , is the supposedly funny character in the film ( every action movie has one ) . \nthe one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line . \nrobin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan\'s baby with extreme annoyance . \nshe gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the film , except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter , or any of the viewers in the audience . \nin one unnecessary scene , tunney walks out of her room and takes her top off . \nis this her job in the film ? \nthe actors are not to blame entirely because the script is terrible . \nyou can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen minutes before it does . \nthis little prediction game is a very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of a movie . \nin a last attempt to make this movie good , special effects are used to try to entertain the audience . \nbut without a memorable action scene in the whole film , the director has not done his job successfully . \nthis film would have gotten a c+ if arnold stood in front of a camera and shouted \" you are a ! $@^@ * ^ \nchoir boy ! ! \" \nfor two hours . \n',neg

'i wont even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films . \ni saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3 , but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them . \nso take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective : alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard days work . \ni didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful ; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing  but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning . \nsigourney weaver , whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination , plays the character of ripley ,  who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3 . 200 years later , scientists use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley - including the alien that was stuck inside her . \nin no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two ; yet ripley is now not completely human , possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being . \nim sure someone can explain exactly why this is so , but for now well just ignore it and move on . \nwhy , you ask , would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated ? \nwell , the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature . \nthese were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research . \nthey ( yawn ) were wrong . \nit doesnt take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un-flossed teeth . \ntheres a little saying that goes something like this : if youre going to make a bad film , do it well .  \ni have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies , but they are not the ones that really bother me . \nalien resurrection , a good example of a film that really gets up my nose , is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one . \nthere is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore , which attempts to distract us from the wandering-but-not-going-anywhere plot . \nin one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off . \nanother one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to . \nfair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story , but this is unfortunately not the case , and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable . \nif you think im struggling to find one good aspect about the film , then you thought right . \none exciting scene is a credit ( and the only part remotely worth seeing ) to the film , in which an alien chases two men ( one a cripple ) up a tall ladder with interesting results . \nbut of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard , and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis . \nso in a film where the one liners come as bad as earth man , what a shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent , its no wonder why alien : resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is . \noh , and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies  the less i enjoy a film , the more i eat . \nso all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes ; but however empty the bag turned out to be , it was still a long way ahead of the movie \n',neg
'this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset : the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st . \nelsewhere for several years , and i had understood that the director/screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also . \ni am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations , nor were they satisfactory . \nif i had to list a reason why . . . . \nbut that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides , it\'s not immediately clear , as there are so many problems with the film . \nadam arkin plays a grade-school teacher who is sardonic , cynical , and somewhat abrasive , but a good teacher . \nhe spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court . \none day , he meets a drifter ( david morse , who plays jack morrison on st . \nelsewhere ) in the park , and inveigles him in a game of one-on-one basketball . \nmorse turns out to be good , and a friendship slowly develops between the two , as their respective professions progress on the screen--arkin\'s teaching , and morse\'s selling of paper flowers to passing motorists . \nso far , my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue , and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack . \ngood music to be sure , but it doesn\'t replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story--it makes the film somewhat minimalistic , a technique i rarely admire . \nsuddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse\'s introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin\'s , a woman arkin has long admired from afar , but it too reticent to approach . \nit appears that she begins to admire morse ( who enjoys here attentions , but isn\'t sure what to do about it--she doesn\'t realize that he is a drifter , and knows nothing about his past ) , and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else . \nuntil then , i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film . \nthe conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full-fledged failure . \nthe woman , at least to me , appeared to be fairly shallow ; i didn\'t realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin , where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse . \nsomehow , this is made to appear as if it is arkin\'s fault , and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he\'s gotten such a find of girlfriend . \nfrankly , dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make ; punching her in the mouth not the least . \nafter this , the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural . \nif i had to summarize a major gripe , it\'s that this is a story spread too thin , that creates semi-likable characters at the outset , and then suddenly jerks them into being 16-year-olds at the last moment . \nit might be true-to-life with some people ; but that doesn\'t mean * i * have to like it . \ni don\'t . \n . \navoid . \n',neg
'the formula is simple . \ntrap a varied group of people on an isolated location , then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one . \nthese have been the successful ingredients for many good films ( the thing , alien , aliens , and tremors to name a few ) . \nso , why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad ? \n ( see the relic for a particularly putrid example . ) \nperhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient : effort and ideas . \ndeep rising meets these two requirements part way , but not enough to salvage the film . \ntreat williams is finnegan , the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services ( and their boat ) for any activity . . . no \nquestions asked . \nthis time , however , they may have gone too far . \ntheir passengers , led by the ominous wes studi , are the type of multi-national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films . \nand their cargo . . . let\'s \njust say it has very high explosive potential . \nwhat is the target of these thieves ? \nwhy , the argonauticus , of course , a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage . \nbut something else is hunting the argonauticus . . . something \nancient and deadly . \nby the time the thieves arrive , nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed . \nand now the creature senses fresh meat ! \nso , you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew , joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald ) , and a thief with less lofty goals , trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep . \nand the monster gets to pick them off one by one . \nfortunately for the creature , this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer . \nwhy else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food . \nif there\'s a more clarion call for unity , i don\'t know what it might be . \nit\'s pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when . \nthere are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end . \nfor the most part , the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience\'s impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first . \n ( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou\'s life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad . ) \ntreat williams is a passable hero , and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation . \nbut while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy , very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way . \nthe biggest treat in the film , however , has to be pantucci , kevin j . o\'connor\'s whining engine-boy , under finnegan\'s employ . \nhis constant quips may be a bit over-written , but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve-addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss , for that matter ) . \nit\'s just a stock part ( the comic-relief character ) , but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable . \nas far as the monster goes , although the cgi is done well , the creature has no logical consistency . \nthink back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters . \nthey all had a set of \" rules \" about what they could do , and how and why they would do it . \npart of the joy of those films was slowly discovering , along with the heroes , just what those rules are . \nthe tentacle monster in deep rising doesn\'t have a set of rules . . . \nor if it does , not a very good one . \nit merely eats ( or drinks , as the case may be ) , and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so . \nthe film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place . \nit simply happens . \nthe action scenes are decent , but few are noteworthy . \nthe film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic . \ndeep rising\'s peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron\'s ( but can you really blame them ) . \nunfortunately , deep rising\'s efforts are more on par with speed 2 . \non the plus side , however , the film\'s closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting ( but unlikely ) sequel . \nperhaps you\'d be better off waiting for that one . \n',neg

'if you\'re debating whether or not to see _breakfast_of_champions_ , ask yourself one simple question : do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie ? \nthe only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph\'s chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross-section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight . \neveryone else--and i\'m hoping that\'s most people--would be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess . \nactually , though , the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle , which focuses dwayne hoover ( bruce willis ) , the owner of dwayne hoover\'s exit 11 motor village in midland city . \nnot only is he a huge success as a businessman , he\'s also something of a celebrity , his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials . \nwith a nice home and family to boot , dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy--yet he\'s not . \nhis wife celia ( barbara hershey ) is perpetually in a pill-induced haze ; his son george ( lukas haas ) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name \" bunny . \" \nnot only that , the environmental protection agency is on dwayne\'s ass over a building development project . \nit\'s enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown--that is , if he doesn\'t succeed in blowing his brains out first . \nmeanwhile , midland city is about to host a fine arts festival , and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout ( albert finney ) , a writer who is far from the renowned author the festival\'s organizer ( buck henry ) was led to believe--in fact , he\'s a penniless hack who writes second-rate sci-fi that appears in porn magazines . \nhis trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey , one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne , who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of life\'s answers . \nthe above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews , but , ironically , i have barely scratched the surface . \ni haven\'t yet mentioned wayne hoobler ( omar epps ) , an ex-con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly-named dwayne . \nthen there\'s the matter of francine ( glenne headly ) , dwayne\'s devoted secretary . \nnot to mention dwayne\'s employee and old friend harry lesabre ( nolte ) , the one with the secret penchant for cross-dressing . \nand so on . \nthe film is essentially dwayne\'s story , but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is . \nrudolph does arrive at a point ( more on that later ) , but it\'s blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material . \nthe surreal visual style , complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwayne\'s ears , is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness , but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad . \nthe actors are called on to act accordingly , resulting in some of the worst , most overdone work all of them have ever turned in . \nwillis fares best of all--but that\'s because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience . \nwith such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time , it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious , and rudolph tries to make a statement . \nunlike _american_beauty_ ( a film that _breakfast_ resembles in more than a few ways , to its great detriment ) , there isn\'t any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift . \nas such , the cartoony characters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned ; and the film attempts , to no avail , to reach a profundity that it doesn\'t deserve . \nvonnegut\'s original novel is considered a classic , but it had been called unfilmable--the same that was said of hunter s . thompson\'s _fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas_ , which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam . \nwith the similar failure of _breakfast_of_champions_ , will hollywood ever learn that books labeled \" unfilmable \" inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable ? \nlikely not . \n',neg
'suicide is pointless , everyone should know that . \nso what\'s this movie like ? \nyou guessed it . . . \npointless . \nthe virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters , from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them . \nwhen the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide , it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever . \nthat\'s what the press materials for the film probably say . \nnow here\'s what i say : the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time . \nboring , arty , pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as . . . \nwell as committing suicide . \nthe movie lost me early on , immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window . \nthe girl\'s father ( james woods ) holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on . \nthen , as the scene ends , the lawn sprinklers come on . \nis that a joke ? \nis that supposed to be amusing in some way ? \nfrom then on , the movie failed to draw me back in . \nperformances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides . \nwoods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen , but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well . \ndunst has the potential to be a big star , if she chooses her projects well . \nand while this film is awful , she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed . \nthere are also a few cameos in the film here and there , which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more . \nas a result , they all seem rather pointless ( although there\'s a brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since . . . \nwell since eddie and the cruisers ) . \nperhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters . \nwe never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what they\'re feeling . \nall we really know is that mrs . lisbon ( kathleen turner ) is strict and keeps them on a short leash . \nwhat mother doesn\'t ? \nit\'s certainly no reason to commit suicide . \nwith the godfather part iii , sofia coppola proved that she had no business being in front of the camera . \nwith the virgin suicides , she proves she has no business behind it either . \nhaving family connections doesn\'t entitle you to be allowed to make movies . \nso attention film directors . . . \nstop letting your daughters pout their way into the industry . \njust because they share your dna doesn\'t mean they share your talent . \n[r] \n',neg
'the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities . \nthe best tales of the genre deal with mankind\'s struggle for survival or knowledge . \nsuch popular and noteworthy tomes as \" stranger in a strange land \" by robert heinlein , \" childhood\'s end \" by arthur c . clarke and \" man in the high castle \" and \" do androids dream of electric sheep \" by philip k . dick all deal with man\'s need for identity and struggle for self worth . \nhollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it\'s beginnings . \nmost films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved . \nit really wasn\'t until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein\'s novel \" rocketship galileo \" and crafted the film \" destination moon \" , that \'sci-fi\' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it\'s own . \nfrom there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre . \nwith the release of touchstone pictures \" mission to mars \" , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe . \nthe film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o\'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission . \nwoody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son . \nentering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) . \nluc consoles jim with woody\'s assistance . \nthe three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them . \nbut jim still longs to set foot on the red planet . \nthe mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars . \nthey send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface . \ngoing out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed \'face on mars\' . \na strange noise emanates from the rock . \nas the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc . \nback on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing . \nluc\'s interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team . \nthe second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger . \nmeteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet\'s surface . \nthe big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars . \nand if so , what is its relationship with us ? \nnow for the bad news . \nthe entire plot of \" mission to mars \" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe . \nthe famed \'face on mars\' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed . \nborrowing ideas from such films as \" robinson crusoe on mars \" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" , and even mario bava\'s \" planet of the vampires \" ( \'terrore nello spazio\' ) ( 1965 ) , \" mission to mars \" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don\'t add up to a satisfying whole . \nwhile some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving . \nso much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use . \nthe performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry . \ngary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation . \nand the mistaken idea of having jerry o\'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse . \nand the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better . \nhe\'s just having too much fun here to give a damn . \nthe script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage . \nthis of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship . \nalso , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation . \nbut the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone . \nsubtlety is non-existent here . \nin fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out . \nthe only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower . \nthe pacing of the film is very leisurely . \nafter the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface . \nthen , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity . \nthe film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum . \nthere are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop . \nthe good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at . \nthe vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring . \nthe design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that hasn\'t been seen since \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" . \nthe visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth . \nthe only fault come with the martians themselves , which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world . \ndirector de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film . \nthe opening sequence alone in a seemingly un-interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage\' to hitchcock\'s \" rope \" ) , as we are introduced to all of the characters . \nscenes in the rescue ship , with its rotating centrifuge , are just amazing in their execution . \nbut the nagging question , is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang . \nsadly it is not . \ndirector brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production . \nthe set design and visual effects are all arresting . \nbut it\'s the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous , thought provoking science fiction . \na disappointing film , but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals . \n',neg
'i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas . \nwith the overt success of the three original star wars films , lucas has become , not necessarily a filmmaker , but the head cheeze at a huge toy company , with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve . \nonly this toy was made for $115 million , but every kid wants it , and , like all other expensive toys , falls apart within an hour after playing with it . \nthe product in question , star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace ( jeez ! ) , is pure and simple : its about the money , baby ! \nno one in their right mind would create such a fiasco if they knew it wouldn\'t make a ton of money before its fourth week of release . \ni come to the sw franchise as a stranger , since i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular . \ni find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy . \nphantom menace is like the first sw , minus 10 . \nnothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable . \neven the special effects seem rather bland . \nthe story in this new one is a mindless mess . . . the \nacting wooden . . . and the action sequences like something out of a video game . \nsw : phantom menace is one of the worst films of the year so far . \nwith a title like sw e1 : tpm , lucas has one big head on those shoulders . \ni thought chris carter did for releasing an x-files movie , although , that movie adaptation was an excellent way to spend two hours . \npm is one long headache . \n',neg
'filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull , dreary , and overused idea . \ndoug liman ( swingers ) , director of the ultra-hip and severely dark comedy go , is an example of just such a filmmaker . \nin his latest , he gives the viewers a raucous , neon-lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested path of misadventure as director . \nbut he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level , bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same . \nhis movie is produced anthology-style -- telling the same story from multiple ( three ) points of view , much as an author might write a serial novel . \nconsistent with this ethic , liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives . \nthe thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter . \nin story a we have checkout clerk ronna ( sarah polley ) looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it ; in story b we have regular drug dealer simon ( desmond askew ) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity ; and in story c we have gay soap actors zack ( jay mohr ) and adam ( scott wolf ) working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal . \nneither of the three stories have much substance , and the movie has the feel of a campfire story ( albeit a rather strange one ) that could be told in five to ten minutes . \n ( in fact , the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . ) \nthe early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie\'s christmas setting , and the los angeles/las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to . \nthe characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite , and performances from little-known players like polley , askew , and taye diggs don\'t help or hurt the roles . \nin fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes don\'t have enough time to make substantial success . \nalthough that\'s almost expected for lack of continuous screen time , the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories . \ngo doesn\'t have this , and it suffers because of it . \nas far as teen movies are concerned , go represents the absolute bottom , for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme . \n ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals , people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers , people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives , or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . ) \nat times , the humor in go is sickly funny , and on a low night , almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers , this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night . \n',neg
' \" you can\'t have any of this . \nit\'s all mine ! \" \n--- a twisted priest ( charles huevelman ) hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana ( angela zimmerly ) looks on uninterested . \nan evil presence , appropriately named the presence ( dj vivona ) , rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him . \nfor kicks , the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered . \nwhen something goes wrong and one of the presence\'s recent victims escapes , the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped . \nthey enlist the help of alison ( ramona midgett ) , a recent suicide victim , to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether-realm . \nher mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was , an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed . \nthe king\'s sorcerer , amblyn ( who also lost his job ) , decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice . \nduring the downtime in his unemployment , amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery , evil , and torture ruled . \nabraham wished to follow his master into this new realm , so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love . \nin this new realm , amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm . \nafter each murder , abraham would become stronger , until his power surpassed that of amblyn\'s . \nbecause of the screw-up that allowed the recent escape , abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself . \nas alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways , the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered . \nif there\'s one thing i can\'t stand when i see a film , it\'s when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty . \nfilms like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this , and now ice from the sun can be added to this list . \nthis film is essentially an 80 minute stalk-and-slash film ( following the dante\'s inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 ) intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and ( supposedly ) haunting images , many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot . \nif there aren\'t bizarre images floating past the screen , then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone . \ncompelling , but ultimately not . \nthe opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images . \nthe credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesn\'t pop up until near the end of the sequence . \nwhen the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv . \nat least the music in the film is pretty decent , made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett . \nat the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them ( and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing ) . \nfor some reason though , he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance . \none over-alled cretin handles the presence\'s gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel , then there\'s an inbred father ( dwight spurgin ) and his two inbred children ( mark kettler and jennifer poirrier-wallace ) that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half dog-half human mix with a shotgun , and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds . \nwhy would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of \" rednecks \" when you yourself had all of these cool powers ?

'an 80-year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch , wearing tight-fitting leather , as she cheers on her favorite tv wrestler by calling his opponent a `pump-bitch\' . \ntwo men messily eat fast food as their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them . \nand roughly 17 people are booted in the crotch . \nwelcome to `ready to rumble\' . \njudging from the fact that potty-mouth adam sandler is the reigning box-office comedy champion , you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that yes , there is an audience for this sort of thing . \nladies and gentlemen , i weep for society . \nmind you , when executed with style and comic ingenuity , jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel ( `there\'s something about mary\' ) and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea ( `dumb and dumber\' ) can be extremely funny . \nunfortunately , `ready to rumble\' is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers , nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired . \n`ready to rumble\' is built around the dedicated fan-base of professional wrestling . . . . \nwhich , in fact , sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy . \nbut director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves , and limited to a stampede of asinine , humdrum bathroom humor , basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and `bio dome\' . \ngordie boggs ( david arquette ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics . \nby day , they transport raw sewage . \nby night ( particularly on ? nitro\' monday ) , they pay homage to their personal hero and savior - jimmy king ( oliver platt ) , the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community . \nwith two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance , gordie and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title first-hand . \nbut unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair ( joe pantoliano , sporting long hair and cowboy boots ) has other plans . \nsinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page ( playing himself ) pummel the king into the tarp , thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered auditorium full of fans . \ngordie and sean are shocked , rioting madly while arguing `this isn\'t even a pay-per view event ! ! \' \nthey take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a come-back attempt . \nalong the way , you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well . \nyou may find something to like in `ready to rumble\' if a ) you are a rasslin\' aficionado yourself , or b ) you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of low-brow comedies . \ni welcome low-brow humor with open arms - that is , if its fresh and resourceful . \n`rumble\' is nothing but a sloppy , frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation . \nthe first half-hour is the ultimate test of patience . \nluckily , the simple-minded events pick up steam , particularly with the well-choreographed wrestling action . \ndirector robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in `varsity blues\' , and when in the ring , he does professional work . \nbut the violence is too excessive . \nhaving the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen hart\'s tragic accident just last year , especially with one character\'s dive during a cage match . \nthis is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of . \noutside the wrestling action , the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term ? scattershot\' , while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10 , with brill\'s extensive vocabulary ranging from `diddly\' to `boob\' and so on . \nthe final tally : i chuckled a few times , groaned a lot , and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105 . \ncasting-wise , `ready to rumble\' is an odd duck . \noliver platt as a champion wrestling figure ? \nhe\'s perhaps a bit chunky , but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty\' , which dampens the blow i suppose . \nrose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader ( `the nirto-est of the nitro girls , \' proclaims gordie ) , but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg , `macho man\' randy savage and sting ( among others ) . \nwcw fans are sure to appreciate these . \nothers . . . \nwell , won\'t . \ni found merit in david arquette\'s bountiful energy as gordie , which brings me to my finishing . . . . \nahhh . . . . \n`praise\' for the film : in `ready to rumble\' , i have discovered something even more annoying than arquette\'s `at&t\' television commercials . \nnow there\'s a low blow for you . \n',neg
'i\'m going to start this review off with a hypothetical question . \nlet\'s say you\'ve just been in a car accident , and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious . \nyour friends have left to go get help , and you\'re waiting to see if the victim wakes up . \na tow-truck comes along , and the driver hops out of the truck to see what\'s going on . \nhe then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck . \ndo you : \na ) run away screaming for your life , staying away from the main road , \nb ) run away ( but not too fast ) and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you , * stop * to catch your breath , try to negotiate with the psycho , and when that fails , start running away again , all the while * staying on the main road * ? \nif you answered \" a \" , you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of \" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation \" and will likely hate this movie . \nhowever , if you answered \" b \" , prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind ! \n \" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation \" is being called a sequel , but it\'s really more of a remake of the original . \nthere\'s a few changes here and there , but it\'s essentially the same ( even the infamous \" meathook \" scene has been re-created . ) \nthe story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom , and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere . \nneedless to say , they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family . \nmuch carnage ensues . \nto call this movie inept would be putting it mildly . \nin addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question , there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere . \nit just swoops down and kills him with its wheel . \nno explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he/she is going around killing people with the planes wheel . \nthe dialogue is even more atrocious . \nzellwegger , who is kidnapped by \" the family \" early on , keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people . \nwhen you\'re surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses , i would think that rationality would go out the window . \nspeaking of going out the window , there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window . \napparently , the stunt double had a little trouble , because she visibly gets stuck in the window . \nthe director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double * doesn\'t * get caught in the window . \nthis was one of many glaring inconsistencies . \nthere are so many , in fact , that if i were to name them all , this review would be several pages long . \nthe only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey . \nhe plays a member of \" the family \" with a hydraulic leg ( home-made , i might add ) and is so completely over-the-top , you can\'t help but be amazed by his performance . \nhe obviously had a lot of fun with this part , and it really shows . \nhe makes jack nicholson\'s portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in \" the shining \" look restrained in comparison . \nfor a horror movie , \" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation \" contains surprisingly little gore . \nin fact , in contains none . \nthere\'s a little blood here and there , but that\'s as far as it goes . \nwhich leads me to believe that the budget must have been * astonishingly * low , and it shows . \neverything about the movie looks cheap , from the sets to the costumes . \nespecially leatherface . \nonce frightening and nightmare inducing , he\'s now as terrifying as dame edna . \ndo yourself a favor and take a pass at this remake . \ncheck out the far superior original instead . \n',neg
'by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered . \nafter all , writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines . \nthe first finds amarillo , texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction . \nas olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects . \nlane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination . \nall the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other\'s protagonist . \nbut then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse . \nlacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years . \nhe\'s not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they\'ve got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise . \ntwo months earlier , lacrosse\'s own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere . \nlacrosse knows his killer\'s work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game . \nit wouldn\'t be fair to reduce everything that\'s wrong with switchback to quaid\'s presence , but it\'s a pretty good place to start . \nthere\'s a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation . \nwe can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he\'s grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp . \na more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film . \nquaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated . \nit\'s tough to become emotionally invested in a character\'s turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes . \neven without quaid , it doesn\'t appear that switchback would have stayed on course . \nthe early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat . \nunfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal . \nonce the mystery of the killer\'s identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable . \nin fact , \" stale and predictable \" describes the direction that switchback takes in general , falling back on far-too-common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere , a climactic fistfight on board a freight train , and edgy law enforcement agents . \nit\'s too bad stuart wasn\'t willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film . \nplayed with atypical restraint by r . lee ermey , he\'s a wonderful , unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions . \na film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling . \ninstead , stuart places his trust in a \" name \" star who can\'t carry the material . \nmaybe next time he\'ll throw away that one crucial page in the script , the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story . \n',neg
'what\'s to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography--ie . \nthe garbage known as \" snuff \" films ? \nnothing , right ? \nwhat\'s to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ? \nwell . . . nothing . \nso , why make it , hollywood ? \nthere\'s no reason why the average , sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic . \nno one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this . \nthe lack of quality filmmaking in \" 8mm \" ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast--all reputable . \nbut joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again ! \nlike paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they\'re few and far ( far ! ) \nbetween . \nbasically , this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it . \nwhy not walk out ? \nwell , this wouldn\'t be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie . \nhere\'s why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of \" 8mm \" . . . \nfirst thing--if you don\'t heed my advice , then understand what you\'re about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud . \nit\'s not easy to watch . \ni didn\'t know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now . \nthe ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator . \na rich old woman discovers a \" snuff \" film in her late husband\'s safe . \nshe calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn\'t it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead . \nshe\'s horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find . \nfamily-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque \" murder \" . \nlet me backtrack for a moment . \nsee , \" snuff \" films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead . \nhowever , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and \" good \" acting make all the difference . \nvery sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies . \nthe thought of this \" industry \" makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i\'ll swallow my bile and move on . \nwelles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry . \nyou\'d think he\'s sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him ! \nhe comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze . \nafter a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , \" snuff \" films . \nskip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead . . . \nled by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer \" machine \" ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue . \nthe movie doesn\'t end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante . \nthis film doesn\'t draw you in . \nit keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ? \nit is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie . \n \" se7en \" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little ) . \nby those jabs , i\'m not only referring to his stylish destruction of the \" batman \" franchise , but \" a time to kill \" was an immensely overrated disappointment . \nfor a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled . \na good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter . \nwriter andrew kevin walker didn\'t recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for \'95s twisted thriller , \" se7en \" . \ndirector schumacher doesn\'t have that innate ability to make you watch things you don\'t really want to see like better directors are capable of doing . \nhe must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don\'t see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it\'s a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered ) . \nhowever , gratuitous is joel\'s middle name . \nhe must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint . \nno , he doesn\'t go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness . \nhe doesn\'t leave much to the imagination . \nit\'s manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante . \nthe script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! ) \ncraft . \ncase in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? ) \ndrives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? ) . \nsee . . . no \nsubtlety . \ndoes joel think we\'re stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ? \nwho do we root for in this mess ? \nis there anybody out there ? \nit\'s not all the director\'s fault , though . \nwhy did the actors sign up for this ? \nnicolas cage is an oscar-winner , for cryin\' out loud ! \nif he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ? \nwhat is cage supposed to be in this movie--a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ? \nvillainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy . \nand what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ? \nhe was so solid as a concerned father in \" a civil action \" . \ni guess ol\' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money . . . or \nthey\'re suckers . \nor they just don\'t care . \nthere are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland . \ncatherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs . wells . \nbaby cindy is obviously cute and wells\' devout love of his daughter is sweet . \nthe mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter . \nthis film has an appropriate blue-toned , washed-out look like \" payback \" ( which was a much better movie ) . \nthe editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue , but at other times it\'s rough . \nduring some conversations , close-ups and wide shots are not cut very well , making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren\'t good and whose timing was a half-second off . \nsuch a technical error indeed stands out . \nspeaking of standing out , don\'t believe the misleading trailers . \nthere\'s not much action here . \noccasionally , yes , but not as often as your tv will have you believe . \nafter seeing \" 8mm \" , i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again . \nis that a positive ? \nwell , if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive , they\'ve done a swell job here . \nit\'ll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance--unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved . \nbut today i\'m not depraved , so i ask , why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it ?

' \" tina ! ! ! fetch me the axe ! ! ! \" \na favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 , paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands . \nit wasn\'t just the film\'s disappointing box office performance . \nindeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times . \nno , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year . \nin a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : \" mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! \" . \nexecutives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late . \nmommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history . \nunfortunately , faye dunaway\'s energetic , at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film\'s only redeeming feature . \nbased on daughter christina crawford\'s trashy biography , mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother . \nif you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania . \nthe film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother\'s will . \njoan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see . \nbut that\'s about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film\'s end . \nthe script - laboured over by four writers , a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum . \nfrank perry\'s direction is no more than competent , and dunaway\'s bitchy lines aside , the dialogue is flat and uninvolving . \nin fairness , the film\'s second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters . \nwhen the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling , joan visits and keeps in touch , not helping her financially but encouraging christina\'s own acting and career ambitions . \ncrawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain . \nyou also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers . \nah , but there is dunaway\'s performance . \nand what a delicious piece of campery it often is . \nhaving just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds , crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden . \nshe has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she\'s making . \nspotting a young tree she doesn\'t like the look of , she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line \" tina ! ! \nfetch me the axe ! ! \" \nwith which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling . \nin the film\'s most outrageous scene , joan realises that some of her daughter\'s clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers . \noh dear ! \nsounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum , doesn\'t it ? \nthis time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst : \" no . . . wire . . . hangers . . . . ever ! ! ! ! \" . \nand later , when the board of her late husband\'s company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship , she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring : \" don\'t fuck with me , fellas ! ! \" . \noh joy ! \nsomething of a camp classic , then , but if that\'s not you\'re cup of tea then mommie dearest doesn\'t have too much to recommend it . \nbetter you see the real crawford in the women ( 1939 ) , mildred pierce ( 1945 ) or whatever happened to baby jane ( 1962 ) . \ngreat films distinguished by great performances , and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perry\'s shrieking piece of tabloid froth . \n',neg

\nhe succeeds once again ! \nplot : a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town , where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open-armed swarm of people with problems . \nit isn\'t long before he befriends the small-town billionaire , folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients . \ncritique : this film is not a comedy ! \nit is a drama . \ni say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer , you would think that this film secures its base in humor , but unfortunately for us , it does not . \nit is a serious film ( seriously flawed if you ask me , but i digress ) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake , but overall , just sits there . \nnow on to my review . \nthis movie sucks because it was slow and boring , starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past , included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst , and certified it all with many a predictable ending . \ni have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture , but whatever it was . . . he \nmissed ! \nanyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff-piece , which on a good day , might be described as predictably digestible . \nit\'s no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy ! \nit sucks as a drama , and bored my movie cohort right to sleep . \ni\'ve given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks . \nfirst of all , i couldn\'t help but think about how much the lead actor , loren dean , looked like a young charles grodin . \nhe even acted like him , save for the dry , sardonic wit . \nthis kept me interested in watching him at least . \nnumber two , and this one is really shallow ( seemed to be geared that way as well ) , there were quite a few \" titshots \" , as they would say back in high school . \nand god help me if i can\'t get enough of those in an aimless drama . \nand three , and this one surprised me the most , actor ted danson\'s cameo ( yes , he will always be sam malone to us real fans ! ) was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person . \na different asshole , but a different person nonetheless . \nif ever you rent this movie one day ( promise you won\'t throw away your hard-earned money at the theaters ? ! ) , \nwait for his scene because it\'s actually pretty good . \nother than that , drab , drab , drab and drab . \neven jason lee , a personal favorite of mine , was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while . \nwell , at least he finally \" came out \" and did some real skateboarding in this movie ! \noh yeah , and i guess that\'s the fourth point in my rating . \nanyway , if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist . . . this \nfilm\'s your bag ! \notherwise , skip it and see analyze this ( 8/10 ) again . . . now \nthere\'s a great shrink movie ! \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : \" three\'s company \" fans alert ! ! ! \nterri from the tv show , also known as actress priscilla barnes , plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film . \nthe scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage , so stay tuned , kids ! \nalso , it is to note that the actress was once named \" penthouse pet of the month \" in march of 1976 . \nshe was known as one joann witty back then . \nshe\'s originally from jersey . \nwho the hell is loren dean , the dude who plays mumford in this film ? \nyou got me , but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name . \njason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971 . \nhe was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats ( 6/10 ) , and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp . he\'s been in every kevin smith film except for clerks ( 8 . 5/10 ) . \nlisten closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film ( the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince ) make a reference to the \" lost ark \" , which is obviously an in-joke , considering that it is the writer/director of this film , lawrence kasdan , who co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) . \nkasdan also played the part of dr . green in 1997\'s as good as it gets ( 8/10 ) . \nted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdan\'s 1981 directorial debut body heat starring a sexy kathleen turner and william hurt . \n',neg

' \" jack frost , \" is one of those dumb , corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film , but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching . \nthis does not come as a surprise , since the studio that made it is warner brothers , who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other . \njack frost ( michael keaton ) is a struggling middle-aged rock musician who loves his wife , gabby ( kelly preston ) , and 11-year-old son , charlie ( joseph cross ) , but doesn\'t spend nearly enough time with them . \nwhen he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play , he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas . \nhalfway there , jack has second thoughts , but on his way back home , is in a car accident and dies . \nswitch forward a year , christmas is approaching once again , and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack\'s death . \nwhen charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died , the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack\'s spirit . \njack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him , but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise . \n \" frosty the snowman , \" is a classic cartoon , and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated , but as a live-action film , it doesn\'t work at all . \nafter a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established , \" jack frost , \" quickly goes downhill , especially once the snowman comes into play . \nsince jack has been deceased for a whole year , you would think there would be many questions to ask him , such as , \" what happens after you die ? \" \nor , \" how does it feel to be a snowman ? \" \nbut instead , the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie . \nthe performances are respectable enough , but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this . \nmichael keaton at least got off easy , since he disappears after the first twenty minutes , but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here ? \ni have always liked kelly preston . \nshe is clearly a talented , charismatic actress , but has never been given a good role in her life , usually having to settle for a one-dimensional supporting character , as in , 1997\'s , \" nothing to lose , \" and , \" addicted to love . \" \njoseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast , since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent . \nin one of the only subplots that actually works , due to its wittiness , henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman . \nthis brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side , however , by the tried-and-true main plot at hand , which is the sappy story of a father and son . \nsince i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around , i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid , cringe-inducing lines of dialogue . \nsome of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father : \" you da man , \" says charlie . \n \" no , i da snowman , \" replies jack . \nor how about this little zinger , coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out : \" snowdad is better than no dad . \" \ndo people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this ? \nthe snowman , created by john henson\'s creature shop , is more believable than the snowman from last year\'s unintentionally hilarious direct-to-video horror flick , also called , \" jack frost , \" but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects . \neither way , it was an awful lot of work to go through , just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project . \nas a seasonal holiday picture , \" jack frost , \" is pretty much a clunker . \na better christmas film from this year is , \" i\'ll be home for christmas . \" \nbetter yet , my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film , such as , \" it\'s a wonderful life , \" \" a christmas story , \" or , \" prancer . \" \n \" jack frost , \" is an earnest , but severely misguided film , and children , as well as adults , deserve better . \ni doubt they would want to see a movie about the death of a parent , anyway . \n',neg

'warner brothers has scored another marketing coup . \nthe one-two punch was started in the summer , with the release of batman forever . \ntrailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat , ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel . \ncarrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever-wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video ( $11 . 99 at wal-mart ) ; a mere two weeks before carrey\'s return in this marketwise , but misfired comedy . \nace ventura : when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubber-faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment . \nhe may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher , in batman forever , but , here , left to his own devices , carrey quickly wears out his welcome . \nthe opening sequence is by far the best--an amusing spoof of cliffhanger , with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon . \n ( you can guess what happens to mr . paws . \nhint : it sounds like splat . ) \nthe plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas , and then to not-so-darkest africa , where ace is on the case of a missing white bat . \nwith his hair and limbs both wildly askew , carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes . \nthe rest of the film is just more of the same . \nsure , the plot\'s linear , and the production values solid , but where is the scripted humor to support carrey\'s sloppy slathering ? \nwriter and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set-ups . \ninstead , carrey just mugs away , playing for the camera even when most of it isn\'t funny . \nthe better gags have been shown in the ads , though a bit with ace emerging buck-naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see . \nthough an arguable improvement over the original , ace ventura : when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten . \nthe script is virtually devoid of wit . \ntribal mask jokes ? \njerry lewis cameos ? \nforget it . \nif anything , the inexplicable presence of simon callow ( four weddings and a funeral ) and bob gunton ( the shawshank redemption ) suggests that working with carrey is the classical actor\'s ultimate challenge . \njust how long * can * they keep a straight face ? \n',neg
'when a pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart , it could mean one of two things : that the recently overworked individual is due for a well-deserved rest , or that either of these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the timing is merely a coincidence . \nthe latter\'s the case with john mctiernan and \" the thirteenth warrior , \" which finally hits theatres a year and counting after its original spring \'98 opening - and fast on the heels of mctiernan\'s \" the thomas crown affair \" remake , a flick that got good reviews . \nyou don\'t have to believe superstitions to wager a guess that \" thirteenth \" won\'t be so lucky . \nreportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton , whose \" eaters of the dead \" novel provides \" warrior \" \'s source ( and its initial title ) , this messy melange of culture-clash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish - sorta like \" braveheart \" without any of the passion . \nbut the bloodshed certainly remains : there\'s enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills , though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness . \nthese circa-10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside . \nthe good guys are loud , crude , often unintelligible and - judging from their highly icky hygiene habits -- pretty smelly to boot , which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador ( antonio banderas ) who tags along quite reluctantly . \nthey\'re also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet violent demises . \nyou\'ll wince , you\'ll groan , you\'ll grouse , \" haven\'t we seen this guy killed twice before ? \" \nbanderas stands confused amidst the chaos , partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animal-skin fashion run amok . \nhe\'s not the hero - his soulful eyes and lean build don\'t exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions - and \" the thirteenth warrior \" wisely doesn\'t pretend he is , allowing his foreign and physically imposing co-stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough . \nlet the characters interaction sans swords and shields , however , and there\'s still a struggle - for the audience to follow or even care about the story . \nit isn\'t the end until audiences have witnessed a half-baked romance , murky political intrigue , veteran actor omar sharif ( \" funny girl \" ) dropping by in a cameo role and a climactic \" indiana jones and the temple of doom \" -esque chase through the villains\' underground lair . \nall this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr . , but the collaboration between \" die hard \" -helmer mctiernan and \" jurrasic park \" -creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights , graphic action and unintentionally telling moments . \nheard during \" the thirteenth warrior \" \'s final scene : a dog whimpering . \nhow appropriate . \n',neg

'any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates . \nfrankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director\'s greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement . \nunfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be \'90s thriller . \nalmost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities . \nthe best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what\'s going on so that these flaws in logic don\'t become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled . \nunfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they\'re happening . \nthis is a very bad sign . \nnot only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder . \nof course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters . \na perfect murder isn\'t a strict remake of dial m for murder , but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott\'s play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock\'s version , as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling ) . \nemily hayes ( gwyneth paltrow ) is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover-and-shaker steven hayes ( michael douglas ) . \ntheir marriage isn\'t going well -- emily resents steven\'s controlling instincts , and , as a form of rebellion , she is having an affair with a penniless painter , david shaw ( viggo mortensen ) . \nwhen steven learns of the relationship , he decides to confront david , but his approach isn\'t that of a typical cuckolded husband . \ninstead of yelling or threatening , steven offers david a proposal that\'s too good to resist : for $500 , 000 in cash ( $100 , 000 before , the rest after ) , he is to break into steven\'s new york apartment and kill emily . \n ( of course , after getting the first payment , david never bothers to ask how he\'s supposed to get the rest . ) \nultimately , i\'m not sure which of the three main characters we\'re supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband , who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune ; her mercenary lover , who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million ; or the woman , who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair . \nnot only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable , but they\'re not interesting . \n ( it\'s possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them , which , in this case , there isn\'t . ) \nsteven , emily , and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes . \nthe actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks . \nmichael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep -- he\'s gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife . \ngwyneth paltrow , who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors , is simply awful here . \nshe now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998\'s worst thrillers ( the other being hush ) . \nat least viggo mortensen ( g . i . \njane ) has a little fun with his part , but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies . \nthe thin supporting cast includes david suchet , the star of \" poirot , \" as a police inspector , and sarita choudhury ( kama sutra ) as emily\'s best friend . \na perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end . \nthere aren\'t many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script , which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start . \nit\'s surprising to see director andrew davis , the man behind the fugitive , involved in this mess , but , like his stars , he too needs to earn a living . \nit\'s just that remaking hitchcock , and doing it so badly , hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough . \n',neg
'steve martin shines but sgt . bilko \nfails to impress \nbased on the popular 50\'s sitcom , sgt . \nbilko follows the string of old-sitcoms-to-movie conversion fever . \nremember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back ? \n ( brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped ) . \ni do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy , but the tv-conversion-movies are hitting our screens like wildfire , sad to say , with mixed success . \nsuch movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following , the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie . \nsgt . \nbilko ( frankly , i have not seen any its original tv version ) , even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd ; failed to entertain . \nsgt . ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool ( place of vehicle storage and repair ) of fort baxter . \nthough totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of , he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money-making opportunities ; from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4-d pools . \nthough materialistic in mind , bilko\'s methods has thoughtfully `enriched\' the lives of the men of fort baxter , providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that . \ncolonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn `blissfully-confused\' state , bilko has managed to hide his operation , though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it . \nbilko\'s state of ascent is suddenly under-fire when the pentagon sends major thorn , a tough cookie on army regulations , to check on the progress on the $70 million hovertank project , a new weapon under development within the fort\'s grounds . \nto add to his problems , thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major `sabo\' done on him by bilko during their younger army days . \ndirector jonathan lynn , who directed my cousin vinny ( in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best-supporting actress ) managed to pull sgt . \nbilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter , but that is about it . \nthere are really not enough laughter-packed-moments in sgt . \nbilko to fully entertain the average movie-goer . \nstill , steve martin\'s sgt . \nbilko is played with finesse and full-force by the renowned comedian . \nwithout him , sgt . \nbilko would have just fell flat on its face . \nsgt . \nbilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world . \nthe current trend in mixed successes in such tv-conversions may be a blessing in disguise , really ; at least it will force hollywood to re-think any of its initial intentions to turn another tv-idea into a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity . \nunless you are a fan of the tv-series or love to watch steve martin in action , you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres . \ni\'m sure there are better ones around . \n',neg

' \" marie couldn\'t talk , \" paulie , the parrot star of his own movie , tells us about the daughter in his original family . \n \" dad couldn\'t listen . \nand mom couldn\'t cope , so they got rid of me . \" \npaulie , the autobiography of a talking , not merely a mimicking , parrot , has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird - the voice , not the body - and as the minor character of benny , a small-time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms . \nas the parrot , mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up . \nbenny , on the other hand , is a character you\'ve seen a thousand times before , and mohr brings nothing new to that role . \nroberts\'s deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig\'s script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems . \nwhen a kids\' movie wants to mosey along , watch out . \nif the material is not crisp and perfectly composed , beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium . \nso it is with paulie . \nwhen they let their bird do his stand-up comedy routines , the show hums and the audience roars . \ntoo often , however , a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again . \ntony shalhoub , the smart-mouthed chef from big night , plays misha , a recent russian immigrant to the u . s . he had been a teacher of literature at home , but now he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study . \nalthough misha gets a few nice lines ( \" i\'m russian . \ni like long stories . \" ) , \nhis somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy . \nbesides paulie , the only character worth noting - other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands - is the speech-impaired marie , played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer , 5-year-old hallie kate eisenberg . \nnaturally enchanting , she gives the picture genuine heart . \nthe bad news is that her part is confined to the first half . \nthe best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills . \nwhen marie\'s family gets a cat , for example , the bird , who hasn\'t wanted to learn how to fly until then , takes an instant interest in soaring . \ntricking the cat while insulting him at the same time , paulie calls him a stupid hairball . \ntheir rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation . \nit\'s good quality sitcom material but performed by animals . \nwhen one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing , paulie cringes . \n \" i\'m a bird , \" he explains with his frequently subtle humor . \n \" i have a small brain , and it\'s about to explode . \" \nthe movie contains rich doses of john debney\'s dreamy music . \nwith heavy use of a solo violin , he keeps reinforcing the film\'s heart-warming themes . \nand when paulie finally takes off in flight , the orchestra comes up loud and strong with cymbals clashing . \n \" it\'s a long story , \" says paulie . \n \" it\'s the only kind he knows , \" reflects misha . \nand the motion picture , which runs the standard length for a kids\' movie , still feels too long . \nthe best parts are enthralling , but then there are all of those dead spots in-between . \npaulie is a movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless . \npaulie runs 1 : 32 . \nit is raged pg for a few mild profanities and would be fine for all ages . \nmy son , jeffrey , age 9 , gave the movie * * with his biggest complaint being that there wasn\'t enough action . \nhe thought paulie was funny , and the actress that played marie was quite good . \nhis friend sam , almost 9 , thought the movie was \" awesome , excellent , \" and gave it * * * * . \nhe thought paulie was good , but he didn\'t believe the way marie\'s speech impediment was acted . \n',neg
'well , here\'s a distasteful , thoroughly amateurish item that , surprisingly , was actually a box-office hit at the time of its release . \nafter just viewing the film for the first time , my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie ? \nit is cheap , idiotic , unfunny , and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was . \nat least some smut would have livened things up a bit . \n \" porky\'s , \" tells the story ( if you can call it that ) of four clueless high school buddies , pee wee ( dan monahan ) , billy ( mark herrier ) , tommy ( wyatt knight ) , and mickey ( roger wilson ) , whom desperately want to get laid . \nwomen , for the most part , are a mystery to them ( and in this movie , they are to the audience , as well , since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet ) . \ntheir plan is sidetracked , however , when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porky\'s , which they are able to get into using fake id\'s . \nafter they pay the manager one-hundred bucks for three hookers , they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building . \nfor these four teenage guys , this means war on porky\'s . \n \" porky\'s , \" ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level . \nas a teenage sex-romp , it is not wild or amusing enough . \nas a comedy , all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat . \nas a look back at the 1950\'s , it is something , i suspect , most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave . \nand as a revenge movie , it is a crushing bore . \none of the most offensive things about , \" porky\'s , \" is how jaw-droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers . \nthe four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters , and we learn very little about them , except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool . \nthat sure is revealing information . \nthe female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark . \nthe women are all treated as objects or comedy props , rather than real people . \nfor example , the two gym teachers , mrs . balbricker ( nancy parsons ) and honeywell ( kim cattrall ) , only have one purpose , and that is to be made fun of . \nmrs . balbricker is a gruff , no-holds-barred , overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness , and , in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved , honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog . \nthere is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses ( even though i have the suspicion they are not ) , but one thing is for sure : they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny , only humiliating . \nto prove how out-of-touch this so-called comedy is , compare it to other more serious 80\'s films about teenagers , and it looks even worse in comaprison . \nany of the john hughes pictures , such as 1984\'s \" sixteen candles , \" or , 1985\'s \" the breakfast club , \" put , \" porky\'s , \" at an even greater shame . \nthose films actually dealt with serious teen matters , but remained a great deal funnier , thanks to their bright and truthful writing . \nand heck , if , \" porky\'s , \" wanted to be a teenage sex movie , i\'d take 1982\'s \" fast times at ridgemont high , \" or 1982\'s \" the last american virgin , \" over this any day of the week . \ndirector bob clark is not a bad director . \ntwo years after he made , \" porky\'s , \" he directed the nostalgic holiday classic , \" a christmas story . \" \ni would forgive him for this misfire , in fact , if it wasn\'t for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay . \njust the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage , and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world , is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in , \" porky\'s . \" \n',neg
' \" the beach \" is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder . \nevery forty minutes of this two-hour film begins with a new theme , virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act . \nit starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment . \nbut then in the second act , the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of \" blue lagoon \" . \nforty minutes later , the mood changes once more , and it becomes a dumbed down version of \" lord of the flies \" where an isolated community is discovered , where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs . \nby the time it\'s over , you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about . \nthe main character of \" the beach \" is angst-ridden richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) . \nhe travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you\'re looking for a good time . \nrichard\'s voice-over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown . \nthis seedy environment is just what richard is looking for . \nhe checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy ( robert carlisle ) . \nhe seems like a raving lunatic , obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis . \nthough his jagged behavior would distress most of us , richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen . \nmoreover , the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life . \ncaptivated by the idea , he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey . \nthey are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise , who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard\'s . \nonce they finally arrive at this paradise , however , the mood of the story shifts to richard\'s growing desire for francoise . \nthis particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard . \netienne is about as exciting as fluffy , white sand . \nit\'s odd that etienne never sees this coming , but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view . \nand once the three stumble across the hidden community ( mood shift imminent ) , more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers . \nfor example , there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards . \nand the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark . \nthere are several ideas that are introduced in \" the beach \" and each one could merit its own feature-length film . \nthere\'s the man vs . nature angle , the love triangle angle , and the utopia-gone-awry angle . \nbut the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred . \ndicaprio , as a result , has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through . \nconsequently , the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up . \n',neg
'after 1993\'s \" falling down , \" i hoped that joel schumacher would mature into a great director . \nsince then he has offered us two so-so adaptations of john grisham novels ( \" the client \" and \" a time to kill \" ) and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise . \nalthough these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher\'s potential , the publicity for his latest release , \" 8mm , \" raised new hope . \nit promised to be something unusual . \nit wasn\'t . \nthe plot goes like this : tom welles ( nicolas cage ) is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman , allegorically named mrs . christian ( myra carter ) , to investigate an 8mm movie found among her late husband\'s belongings . \nthe movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a man in a leather mask ( who reminds me of bane in schumacher\'s \" batman & robin \" ) . \nbecause murders can be realistically simulated in movies , mrs . christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead . \nby combing through missing persons reports , tom finds the girl\'s name and tracks her to los angeles . \nwith the aid of max california ( joaquin phoenix ) , a video store clerk ( and another symbolic name ) , tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff . \nthe plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schrader\'s \" hardcore , \" in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter . \nboth films are modeled on dante\'s \" the inferno , \" of course ; \" 8mm \" makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil . \n \" hardcore \" is a much more subtle and meaningful film . \n \" 8mm \" had a lot of promise . \nin its better moments it\'s an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom . \none moment of the first sort : when we first meet max he\'s reading truman capote\'s \" in cold blood \" underneath the cover of a porn novel . \n \" in cold blood \" was the father of the true-crime genre , which is the literary equivalent of snuff films . \nmax promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom , \" dance with the devil and the devil don\'t change ; the devil changes you . \" \ntom does change-i\'ll let you discover the specifics for yourself-but not permanently . \nschumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker didn\'t have the guts to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldn\'t come back . \n ( walker\'s \" seven \" did a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise ) . \ncage tries hard to pull it off , but the script doesn\'t give him enough to work with . \nphoenix walks away with the movie-he\'s smart , charming , and funny . \nother cast members include \" fargo \" \'s peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and \" the sopranos \" \'s james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far . \nin the last analysis , since \" 8mm \" falls short of its pretensions and its promise , its just another private eye story in the raymond chandler/ross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege . \nhowever , unlike other predictable fare in the genre-last year\'s \" twilight , \" for example- \" 8mm \" is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is . \n',neg

' \" america\'s sweethearts \" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn\'t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . \nalmost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting \" comic relief \" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) . \ncrystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . \n \" america\'s sweethearts \" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . \nit\'s a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation . \nby the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . \njohn cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . \nof the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled \" time over time , \" are far from rosy . \nwhile eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen\'s solo films have tanked . \nto make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a \" visionary \" who purchased the unabomber\'s cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . \ndesperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation . \nlee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . \nhe enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen\'s sister , personal assistant and whipping girl . \nwhat lee doesn\'t know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness . \npress junkets are a haven for control freaks . \nstudios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand . \ngenerally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel . \nthe next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . \nevery 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . \nthe atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets . \nrepresentatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . \nthey get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges . \nthe \" reporters \" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . \nplacing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit . \nthe junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . \nfor most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press . \nwhen they do deal with journalists , the \" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters \" premise is de-clawed . \ngwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions . \nlee certainly isn\'t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . \nis the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? \nhell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . \nall of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in \" america\'s sweethearts \" is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn\'t matter because any publicity is good publicity . \nand thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . \nso what about the cast ?

'synopsis : two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry ( woody harrelson ) - - an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post , tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye , has ill-timed fits of coughing , and fails at everything he does . \nthe story is told from harry\'s point of view . \nharry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn\'t drink . \none day harry is approached by the con girl rhea ( elisabeth shue ) , who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesn\'t smoke . \nseduced , harry agrees to participate in a money-making scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette ( chloe sevigny ) , the teenage daughter of a rich man . \nturns out , it\'s all part of a needless , very puzzling , extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme ( it involves hiring special impersonators ) by two cons in order to fool harry , a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post . \nwhen the \'kidnapped\' odette is found dead , the clues point to harry as the kidnapper/murderer , and the police are hot on harry\'s trail . \nharry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money . \ncan he get out of this mess ? \nopinion : palmetto is a long , uninteresting film with all the wrong feel . \nhero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence . \nthis farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof . \nbut palmetto is played like a dark , serious , detective noir drama , and watching harry\'s bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction . \nthere\'s a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts , buttocks , short skirts , colored painted nails , and women\'s legs . \neven when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema , you can always notice the side of elizabeth shue\'s breast forming a prominent foreground . \ntowards the end , palmetto re-focuses on plot for the grand finale - - a confusing explanation involving impersonators , with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals\' confession . \nif you can imagine \'shemp\' from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo \'lingerie suspense\' thriller , that\'s how out of synch this movie feels . \n',neg

'when i was nine , i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store . \nmasters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures : they combined science fiction and fantasy , had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read . \nof course , the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history . \ngiven the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon ( not to mention its moderately successful spin-off she-ra : princess of power ) , it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together , come with the result of \" trillions \" and make a live-action masters movie . \nlet\'s be blunt : masters of the universe is a very bad movie . \nthe story is painfully dull and mind-numbingly cliched ( hands up who * wouldn\'t * guess he-man and skeletor take their fight into the real world ) and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors ( dolph lundgren as he-man for one ) or good actors ( james tolkan , meg foster ) given such awful characters and dialogue that they can\'t help but seem terrible . \nit is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars . \nwe have the alien bounty hunters , the desert skif technology , stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that \" deja vu \" is too polite a term to use in describing it . \n \" blatant uninspired ripoff \" would appear more appropriate . \ntv fans might want to check out courtney cox ( monica in friends ) and robert duncan mcneill ( lt paris in star trek : voyager ) , very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either . \nso in the face of such mindless sub-mediocrity , is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all ? \nyes , there is . \none incredible good reason . \nhis name is frank langella . \nlangella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood , appearing in countless films over the years . \nhere he plays skeletor , the villain of the piece . \ndressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face , he is one part darth vader , one part emperor and two parts grim reaper . \ngiven this character , langella falls right into it with style and precision . \nskeletor is believable , interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right . \nmasters of the universe . \ni remember loving it when i was eleven . \nat twenty one it\'s difficult to see why . \nbut , as i said , it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder . \nbesides , this year marks the film\'s 10th anniversary . \nwatch it with some friends for a good laugh and celebrate . \n',neg
'in 1970s , many european intellectuals , especially those on the left political hemisphere , became obsessed with the rise of fascism . \nwhich wasn\'t so hard to expect , because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies . \nin such times , when political involvement could be associated with noble passion , many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre-war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany . \nof course , there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other , less noble reasons . \nfor them , moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era . \nwhich , naturally , made some of those films very popular among teen audience . \none of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass , who later made career shooting expensive , stylish soft porn . \nsalon kitty , his 1976 film , is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern , book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2 . \nin 1939 , walter schellenberg , one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite , exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats . \nnone of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents , and that all the rooms happened to be bugged . \nthe most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty , nominal madame of the brothel , didn\'t know the real purpose of that enterprise . \nscreenplay by tinto brass , of course , simplifies the story and changes few names . \nschellenberg is now wallenberg ( helmut berger ) , ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top . \nkitty kellerman ( ingrid thulin ) , apart from being madam , has a second job as a cabaret singer . \ncaught in the net of depravity is sweet , innocent girl margerithe ( theresa ann savoy ) thrown into brothel . \nthere she falls in love with customer hans reiter ( bekim fehmiu ) , disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe . \nwhen margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel , she finds out that the place is bugged . \nshe informs the madam of the real situation , and both women decide to confront wallenberg . \nthose who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film , that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation . \nbut , although salon kitty doesn\'t happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn ( although not very successful ; some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing ) , it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict - this time between power-hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty . \nunfortunately , brass seems to overuse other cinematical references , probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino visconti\'s the damned , but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulin\'s unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minelli\'s musical numbers from cabaret . \nall in all , salon kitty is failure , although with some very interesting moments . \n',neg
'the general\'s daughter is a heartless , absurd film , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters . \ndirector simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth . \nwhat\'s worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm . \njohn travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) . \nbrenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth\'s mentor , colonel moore ( james woods ) . \nsoon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who . \nebert\'s law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story . \nperhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it\'s painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something . \non a story level , the general\'s daughter is ineptly constructed . \nthe film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille\'s novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and \" shocking \" plot developments . \nhaving not read the novel , it\'s difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree . \nscene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines . \n ( sunderland actually asks brenner , \" why was she killed ? \" \nto which i would have answered , \" if i knew , then the movie would already be over . \" ) \nonly after we\'ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored . \nnot that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot . \nin one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask . \nshe sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring . \ninstead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner\'s houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap . \nthis scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it\'s gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film\'s complete disregard for the characters and the audience . \nit was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise . \ni realized that these constructs on screen aren\'t actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story . \nthis would have been bad enough without the west\'s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct . \ncompelling films about sexual crimes don\'t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don\'t show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture . \nthese scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they\'re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be . \nin addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it\'s a perversion of everything we know to be pure . \nthis standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up . \nas it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane . \nperhaps the only positive elements in the general\'s daughter are a couple of the performances . \njames woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety . \ni also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous . \nnonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization . \nthe general\'s daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments . \n',neg

'jet li busted onto the american action movie scene , when he stole the show in 1998\'s lethal weapon 4 , with his wicked looks , his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma . \nit only took another two years for mega-producer joel silver to set him up in an all-american movie , primed to take over some of the empty action-hero seats left by alleged coke-head van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal . \nwould this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts , namely chow yun-fat and jackie chan ? \nlet\'s find out . \nplot : rival chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another , when members of their respective families start turning up dead . \nthat\'s when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brother\'s death and to exact some of his own style of revenge . \ncritique : three words : not enough action ! \nsimple enough ? \nnot enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay , bad actors , crappy dialogue and oh-so many over-the-top melodramatic moments . \nand a romance angle ? \nwhy , one must ask . . . why ? \ni love fight scenes and i really dig jet li too , but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences , and jet , well , the poor dude was barely in the movie . \nand i thought this was supposed to be his big break ? \nhow \'bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kung-fu fighting chops , slap him in a few more scenes , and give him more chances to practice his acting/english abilities ? \nwhat a letdown . \neven black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up , empty shell of a film . \nin fact , i am sure that more time was spent gathering the \" hits \" for the soundtrack of this film , than were on the so-called \" screenplay \" . \ni felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time . \nthe sad part about the bad script is that it wouldn\'t matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines . \nbut no , save lindo and aaliyah , who weren\'t too shabby , i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly . \nand what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some 15-year old looking guy , acting like he\'s the overlord of a drug ring ? ! \nwhat a mess . \nthen again , i don\'t want it to seem like i\'m complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable , since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway , not the story . \nwell , i guess that\'s what disappointed me the most out of this film . \nthere were a couple of cool fight scenes with li , but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving . \nalso , as much as i love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some of their stunts , a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt . \nit should be seamless , fellas , not necessarily against the laws of gravity ! \nthe one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by a blow , but that simple creative touch couldn\'t save the rest of this film\'s uninteresting plot movements . \ni\'m disappointed for jet li that this film didn\'t give him the real opportunity to star in a good story with many great action scenes . \nhopefully , the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor . \nfor now , i just hope that for his sake , the film\'s title isn\'t a premonition of the movie\'s ultimate fate at the box-office . \n',neg

'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \n \" quick , robin ! \nthe anti-shark repellant ! \" \n- adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg \ni had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard . \nthis is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it\'s loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill . \nbatman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o\'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss . \nby ivy\'s side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast . \nthe villains\' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy\'s intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life . \nmeanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone ) . \nakiva goldsman\'s screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement . \nit makes goldsman\'s screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison . \ni am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i\'d seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan\'s island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production . \njoel schumacher\'s direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance . \nthere is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly-pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy\'s chosen new abode . \nanother action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late-night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons . \nmr . schumacher\'s focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective . \nit is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film\'s opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered . \nis batman and robin supposed to be campy ? \ni think it is - it\'s hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously . \n ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted \" bomb ! \" \neach time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory . ) \nis it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ? \ni somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn\'t attempting to be the utter farce which it is . \narnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr . freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be . \nmr . schwarzenegger\'s attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable . \nby the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen . \nthe bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of \" cool ! \" \nin the least inventive way . \ngeorge clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film . \nhis batman is hardly an imposing figure . \nchris o\'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all . \nthe film\'s one saving grace ? \nundoubtably uma thurman\'s entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy . \nher work in batman and robin is certainly over-the-top , but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film . \nms . thurman\'s comic timing is impeccable , and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully . \n ( i\'m already starting to positively reassess jim carrey\'s performance in batman forever . ) \nher amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film , and when she\'s offscreen the film greatly suffers . \ni figure that if one has to die , being kissed to death by uma thurman isn\'t a half-bad way to go . \nwhile batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse-pounding excitement , i must admit that i was not bored watching it , although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening - my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one-liner , and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat . \nit\'s been a long time since i\'ve laughed so much at a movie . \n \" at \" , of course , is the operative word . \n',neg
' \" varsity blues \" is the best film of 1999 thus far . \nunfortunately , it is also the first film i have seen from 1999 . \nit is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-heartedfrom 1999 . \nit is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-hearted protagonist ; a rough and meanspirited coach ; and the \" big game . \" \nby the end , will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph ? \nwill everyone in the town turn against the coach ? \nwill the team win the climactic game ? \ndo cats bathe themselves regularly ? \nthe so-called \" hero \" in question is john moxin ( james van der beek ) , a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team , but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead-end town . \nat least he\'s got the right idea , since west canaan , texas is portrayed in the film as , frankly , pathetic , with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming . \nheck , in one scene , the front page of the town\'s newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers\' big win the night before . \nwhen the team\'s star quarterback is severely injured , tearing the ligaments in his leg , john finds himself taking over as the team\'s leader , but his few minutes of glory do not last long , as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend ( amy smart ) when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ( ali larter ) . \nand after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second-to-last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the \" bad guy \" ) . \nworse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john\'s scholarship chances if the badgers don\'t win their final game . \nthe plotting of \" varsity blues \" is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book . \nadmittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained . \nthroughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983\'s \" all the right moves . \" \none of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were , least of all certainly not john , who , played by van der beek ( of tv\'s \" dawson\'s creek \" ) , is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities . \nwhile i probably shouldn\'t blame this on van der beek , since the inauspicious and \" by-the-numbers \" screenplay by w . peter iliff isn\'t of any help , he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in \" all the right moves . \" \nthe story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama . \nthe romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don\'t think i\'ve seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence . \nsmart does not allow her character to become the \" passive girlfriend , \" instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions . \nit\'s too bad the camera didn\'t linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts . \nthe adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football . \njohn\'s relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance . \nhis father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john doesn\'t want any part of that . \nhis mother stands beside her \" big , strong husband \" and is a passive female . \nfinally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one-dimensional . \nsaving \" varsity blues \" from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me . \nthe scenes of playing football were well-shot and thankfully didn\'t overstay their welcome , as many sports films fall victim to . \nbut leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ? \ni seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood . \ndo we really need another high-school sports film ? \nno , we don\'t , and certainly not one of this low-caliber , which felt like a cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films . \n \" varsity blues , \" no doubt is the first one , however , to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts . \n',neg

'for his directoral debut , gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent , alcoholic husband and father , and the various lives he affects . \nbut while the characters , places and events may have special meaning to the writer-director , the audience is left in the dark . \nthe center of this tale is the abusive raymond ( ray winstone ) , and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him . \nhe spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars . \nthen , he returns home to his pregnant wife , valerie ( kathy burke ) and their five-year-old daughter . \nraymond demonstrates his violent tendencies ( and his paranoid delusions ) early on when he accuses valerie\'s brother , billy ( charlie creed-miles ) , of stealing . \nraymond then proceed to beat ( and bite ) him to a bloody wreck . \nbut these are the least of billy\'s problems . \nbilly is a heroin addict on the downturn , and it doesn\'t seem that he\'ll last much longer . \nbilly and valerie\'s mother , janet ( laila morse ) , is raymond\'s nemesis . \nshe disapproves of him ( and he of her ) , but is powerless to do anything about it . \nshe merely struggles on , hoping her children will survive their respective torments . \nif this description seems bleak , i haven\'t told the half of it . \nthis is not a cheery movie , and most of the time it\'s downright depressing . \nwhile at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick , and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him , in the end , it\'s not quite worth it . \nthere are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose . \ntake for example the extended sequence where one of billy\'s scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy . \nthe film is filled with these \" character moments \" that never really achieve anything . \ngranted , there are a few genuinely powerful ( and sickening ) moments in the film , but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us . \nthe actors do a fine job , particularly in the central roles . \nthe good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes , and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into . \nthe bad thing about an actor turned director is that there\'s no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices . \na good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience . \noldman got it about half right . \n',neg
'and i thought \" stigmata \" would be the worst religiously-oriented thriller released this year . \nturns out i was wrong , because while \" stigmata \" was merely boring and self-important , \" end of days \" is completely inept on all fronts . \nit\'s a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess . \nfor a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it\'s extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up . \nfor the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and \" batman & robin \" doesn\'t count ) is no fun at all . \n \" end of days \" is a major stinker . \nthe movie opens in vatican city , 1979 . \nsome catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation . \nif he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed . \nthe pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed . \nin new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy . \ntwenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex-cop with a drinking problem . \nnow working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil . \nan assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney ) . \nrecognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her . \nthere are so many problems with this film it\'s hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? \ncasting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with . \nschwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea . \narnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions . \nin other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake . \nharrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they\'ve all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger . \nthere are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho\'s character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine\'s location by offering him his old life back . \nnone of these scenes really work , because arnie isn\'t up to the task . \nthe filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before . \nthis one isn\'t at all believable the way arnold plays him . \nthe supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all . \nas the prince of darkness , he\'s suave and confident . \nhe acts like one would expect the devil to act . \nthe problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain . \nbyrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil . \nbyrne\'s speech about the bible being \" overrated \" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold\'s attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the \" \'tis not ! \" \nvariety ) are feeble at best . \nthe only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares . \nkevin pollack plays jericho\'s security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour . \nrobin tunney isn\'t given much to do except look scared . \nin fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do . \nperformances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it . \nthis being an action blockbuster , it\'s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it\'s utterly ridiculous . \nwhy is the devil coming on new year\'s eve , 1999 ? \nbecause it\'s exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn\'t 666 , it turns out . \nsome nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you\'ve got 1999 ! \nif you don\'t buy this explanation , you\'re not alone . \nit\'s convoluted and silly at the same time . \nthe method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she\'s christine , see , and she lives in new york , see . \n . \n . ) , and if that weren\'t bad enough , there\'s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn\'t explained at all . \nwhy can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he\'s powerless ? \nis he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? \nhow come he can\'t control jericho or christine ? \nand how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ? \na clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it\'s never actually explained . \nusually , this sort of thing wouldn\'t matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don\'t get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting . \nthere are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in \" end of days , \" complete with the old \" black cat hiding in a cabinet \" bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there . \nit gets so formulaic that it\'s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a \" boo \" will come . \ntheir predictions will rarely be wrong . \nthe more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don\'t care about these characters ( due to the script\'s pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don\'t make any sense . \nthere\'s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady . \nit\'s good for a few chuckles , but not much else . \nsupposedly we\'re to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly . \nnone of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it\'s often hard to tell why it\'s happening in the first place , not to mention that they\'re edited in full-on incomprehensible mtv quick-cut style . \nmost of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , \" wow , cool ! \" \n \" end of days \" is not only silly and confusing , but it\'s also distinctly unpleasant to watch . \nthe devil apparently doesn\'t operate in the more subtle , i\'ll-convince-people-to-kill-each-other fashion outlined in the bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight . \nthis doesn\'t only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that not a single scene in \" end of days \" goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me scratching my head ) . \nif violence is supposed to be shocking , it\'s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb . \nscenes aren\'t connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff gets blown up , or people get killed , and i had no idea why . \nreasons ? \nto hell with reasons ! \nlet\'s just blow stuff up ! \nisn\'t it cool ? \nnope , not by a long shot . \nthis film is thoroughly unwatchable . \nit\'s dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity . \nperhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it\'s not happening with hack peter hyams here . \n \" end of days \" might have had camp value , if only it didn\'t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody\'s going to buy . \nif the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script . \nif it\'s going to be campy , arnold shouldn\'t be taking himself so damn seriously ( i didn\'t actually see him put up on a cross , did i ? ) , and his character shouldn\'t be such a sad sack . \nas it stands , \" end of days \" is just a bad movie , and an awfully gloomy one at that . \n',neg
'die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect . \nplace the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film\'s pathetic screenplay . \nevery line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor . \nthe plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land . \nthe film has zero credibility , and all of the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut-outs . \nso much for the script . \nhow about the action ? \nwell , let\'s put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator--all standouts for their hair-raising suspense . \nby contrast , harlin doesn\'t have a clue when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2 never picks up steam . \ndie harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute . \nin fact , the movie often seems deliberately campy , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it\'s good . \nyou do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it . \ndie hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff . \n',neg
'i am a steven seagal fan . \ni only say this now because \" mufti splenetik \" isn\'t my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things . \nany proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on . \nseagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we\'ll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it\'s a real-life model-wife who hasn\'t worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine . \nnot to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he\'s been in since nico doing his \" my hands are sharp , nimble knives \" thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull . \nin the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest . \nhe\'s also put on quite a lot of weight . \nsmall potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain\'t broke , why fix it ? \n ( more on this disappointed person\'s dashed expectations later ) . \nas jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past . \nwhile he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole . \nit turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can\'t trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that \" glimmer man \" thing . \nan increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole\'s former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons . \nthe glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) . \nit\'s the other changes that disappoint . \nfor example , although there\'s a fair amount of violence in this movie , there\'s also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television\'s \" in living colour . \" \nwayans plays whiney straightman to seagal\'s bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his \" are you crazy \" part of the dialogue with wasted zest . \nas campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner\'s eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal\'s wooden comebacks make for painful watching . \na cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble . \nhe chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies . \nagain , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual . \nheck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film . \nis that a lot to ask of the seague ? \ntoo much . \nseagal\'s best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone . \nnot for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think . \nno kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows . \nthat\'s really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else . \nwe trusted him . \nwe got to know him . \nnow , betrayal . \ni don\'t know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he\'s going to try to be funny again . \ni\'ll try , but it won\'t be easy . \nif you haven\'t watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out . \nit\'s easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences . \nafter all , if we can\'t depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ?

'sylvester stallone has made some crap films in his lifetime , but this has got to be one of the worst . \na totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting , \" the specialist \" is about as exciting as an episode of \" dragnet , \" and about as well acted . \neven some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script , stupid and unlikable characters , and just plain nothingness . \nwho knew a big explosion could be so boring and anti-climactic ? \nunless you saw \" blown away \" . . . \n \" the specliast \" of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone ( in comeback #19 , i think ) , who plays a quiet , hermit-like bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something , but who suffered a change of heart when he and his assistant ( james woods , who shows us exactly what over-the-top is , other than another bad sly film ) accidentally killed some innocent people during a job . \nhis credo is killing bad people , not innocents . \nand that\'s why he makes big bombs . \nso anyway , into his life steps the seductive sharon stone , who is basically the girlfriend/moll of the stupid son ( eric roberts ) of a cuban/miami kingpin ( rod steiger , in an indecipherable accent , which is sometimes cuban , sometimes brando , sometimes scottish , etc ) . \nturns out sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him , since he killed her parents when she was young . \nso she calls sly , leaves messages with him , sends him e-mail , etc , about planting a bomb to kill roberts , which sly listens to obsessively , and while he works out naked . \nyea . \nalso into his life , though again , comes woods , who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly . \nusing the cops , he tries to set up traps , none which really work , so when sly calls him , he goes ballisitic on his ass over the phone , getting so worked up by saying his must-be-improvised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open . \nthese are the most exciting scenes in the film , and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film . \nthe film tries to offer us a moody film noir , except with explosions , but comes up completely snake-eyes . \nit\'s just a pretend film noir , making it a big waste of time . \nand for action buffs , the action scenes are pretty lame , with some really unrealistic-looking special effects ( a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a piece of cardboard falling into a tub ) . \nthen there\'s the much-discussed sex scene between sly and stone , which are about as mispaired a couple as rachel and ross on \" friends . \" \ntheir sex scene is more nauseating then sexy , because it shows us more of sly than stone . \nnow let\'s guess who we\'d rather see naked , okay ? \nstone\'s small but perky breasts , which we\'ve seen more times than harvey keitel\'s dick , or stallone\'s veiny ass , which isn\'t usually shown for a very good reason ? \ni know i can\'t really judge it as a flaw of the film , but come on . \nthe worst flaw of the film is this : it\'s boring . \ni mean , i was on caffeine when watching it , but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting . \nbut a good movie does not james woods going nuts make . \nif you\'re in for some fun action , rent sly\'s earlier \" demolition man , \" which sucks too , but in a much more entertaining fashion . \nskip this dull film , unless you want to see woods , or make fun of steiger\'s accent , or see stone\'s breasts again . \n',neg
'it\'s difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of \" award-winning \" tv commercials , as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes . \nthat said , hayes\'s feature film debut lives up to expectations , coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic . \nbut occasionally , bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary . \nthose moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film\'s two stars , jake gyllenhall as the immuno-deficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his over-protective , hyper religious , reagan-loving mother . \ngyllenhall\'s sweet-natured delivery of jimmy\'s hilariously na ? ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming-of-age story : jimmy is a bubble boy , a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ -- a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld . \nhis mom home-schools jimmy , filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and anti-sexual messages , until he\'s befriended by chloe ( marley shelton ) , the beautiful girl next door . \njimmy falls in love with chloe , but is afraid that his love will literally kill him , as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss . \nbut when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend , jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinks-addled cross-country voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love . \nthe offensive bits have little to do with jimmy\'s rare handicap ( regardless of what the film\'s protesters would have you believe ) , but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes , including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi . \nbut even if you find stereotype humor funny , it\'s hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags . \nthey even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks . \nbut a few of the harsh jabs manage to work , especially in the case of kurtz , who very bluntly shows the dark , hypocritical side of the religious right , and a wacky send-up of a cult called \" bright \'n shiny , \" led by the inimitable fabio . \nunfortunately , a few giggles can\'t make bubble boy the riotous , off-the-wall comedy it so desperately wants to be . \nhonestly , it\'s a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made , and i\'m not just saying that because it\'s so mediocre . \nhow odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesn\'t seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many . \nand now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of real-life bubble boy david philip vetter , maybe disney\'s wondering the same thing . \nhope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile . \n',neg
'a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets . \nthe film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities . \nthe result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn\'t build on to show them as the poets they were . \non paper , this shouldn\'t have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( \" the secret garden \" ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast . \nbut the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud . \ni found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade . \nhe , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be . \nbut when the two of them were together , it looked like a mismatch . \nleonardo\'s rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude , yet we know from rimbaud\'s poetry , that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring . \nthe film opens in post-revolutionary france in 1871 , the 16-year-old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems . \nhe accepts verlaine\'s praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home , and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville . \nonce there , rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household , has an immediate conflict with verlaine\'s busty 18-year-old wife mathilde ( romane ) , and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family\'s money , even though he has nothing else in common with her . \nwhen verlaine states , \" poets can learn from one another , \" rimbaud replies in a haughty tone , \" only if they\'re bad poets . \" \nhe will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship . \nverlaine proves to be weak-willed , beating his wife regularly , and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud . \nwhen mathilde\'s father kicks rimbaud out of the house , verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers . \nit\'s a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets , which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce . \nin brussels , verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail . \nwhile rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 . \nhe instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun-runner , and after ten years there , comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 . \nthe hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying . \nthe film ends on a whimper . . . with \nverlaine talking with rimbaud\'s sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses , which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published . \nthis film was especially annoying because rimbaud\'s poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film , as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry . \ni have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film , but whatever it was , it just didn\'t work . \nit certainly didn\'t bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so-called father of modern poetry . \n',neg
'synopsis : in \" sooner than you think \" america , the future of law enforcement resides in blade squad , a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs . \na dangerous criminal , however , attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them . \ncomments : so , what do an ex-gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop , a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem , and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common ? \nwhy , they\'re all members of blade squad , an elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms , rollerblades , and jetpacks ! \nthey also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another a la the marines in james cameron\'s aliens . \nyes , it\'s blade squad , the fox network\'s wednesday night movie of the week . \nthis \" movie , \" marking its dubious world premiere today , curiously has a number of guest stars . \n \" how can a movie have guest stars ? \" \nyou may ask . \nwell , blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie . \nblade squad is dumb . \nblade squad is loud . \nblade squad is obnoxious . \nblade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long-lived tv series . \nwhy not ? \nafter all , television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars ( \" knight rider \" ) , fast helicopters ( \" airwolf \" ) , and super fast motorcycles ( \" street hawk \" ) , and viewers have eaten it up in the past . \nso , why not crimefighters with jet-powered roller blades ? \nto be honest , as a made-for-tv presentation , blade squad is at least watchable . \nthe film has a relatively large cast of characters , a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script , and enough action sequences to keep one half-interested . \ni\'d imagine adolescent males , probably the target audience of this turkey , would get a kick out of it . \ni tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad . \ni can remember liking \" airwolf \" and \" street hawk \" when i was 10 or 11 . \nand , although this isn\'t saying much , blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful generation x ( a huge disappointment considering the comic book\'s terrific two-year beginning ) . \nbut , i digress . \ndespite its limited appeal , blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series . \none , it suffers from mtv syndrome : a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer\'s senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background . \noh yeah , dylan\'s \" knockin\' on heaven\'s door \" and bowie\'s \" i\'m afraid of americans \" are used here , in rather poor taste . \ntwo , blade squad needs a new crew for the sound . \nthe substandard sound editing irritated me to no end . \ncharacters\' dialogue , at times , sounded choppy and unintelligible . \nduring one important scene , a song played loudly in the background . \nwhen a character spoke , the song\'s volume dropped but did not disappear . \nas soon as that character finished speaking , the song\'s volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke . \nthis sounds trivial , i\'m sure , but it distracted me immensely . \nfinally , this is commercial television . \nfoul language is not allowed , typically , on commercial television . \nthus , don\'t use foul language in a made-for-tv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner . \nin an early scene of the film , for example , the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets . \nwhen the good guy spouts out a bad word , a driver conveniently honks his car\'s horn off-screen to muffle the word out . \nin a \" seinfeld \" episode , this technique proved funny ; here , it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably . \nperhaps future writers , if a show is spun out of the movie , could take a cue from marvel comics\' 2099 series of comics . \nmake up a bunch of new bad words for the future . \nthis way , you don\'t need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language . \ncompared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies , blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp . \nwhen compared to , say , a movie studio film , blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials : bs . \n ( review written august 12 , 1998 ) \n',neg

common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers . \nbut they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night\'s end . \nthose who are invited are the ones that have the issues . \nit is up to those who aren\'t to help them come to terms . \nfirst there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica\'s and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof . \nhe is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production . \nbridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year\'s eve and tag along to the party with them . \nthey stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections . \nhe is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school . \nhis lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch . \nas bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy . \nmoving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts . \nval is monica\'s cousin and a true fan of the new york scene . \non the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can\'t find . \nparadoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren\'t successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds . \nof all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot . \nwisely , the movie\'s creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless . \npaul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship . \nhowever , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening . \nfinally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film . \njack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy\'s virginity the night before . \nwhile she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy . \nvery often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory . \nhowever , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted . \ninstead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies . \nfirst , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot . \nat other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot . \nthere are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish . \nnot in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver . \nand yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots . \nperhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end . \nbut it didn\'t happen that way . \nthe cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight . \n',neg
'burnt money is the perfect festival film . \nit will show once or twice , and then no one , thankfully , will ever have to hear from it again . \nthis film from the seattle international film festival 2001\'s emerging masters series is easily one of the year\'s worst . \nbilled as a gay `bonnie and clyde\' , this gritty film from director marcelo pi ? eyro has its only highlight in a well-designed title sequence . \ntwo gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader , whose plan they screwed up , angry . \nthis causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys , one of whom may not actually be gay . \nhiding out in a prostitute\'s apartment , the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movie\'s conclusion . \nif caught , they risk losing all the money , and their love . \nas an added emotional bonus , one of the gay men is dying . \nor something like that . \neverything that happens is so quick and confusing i was completely lost . \nclarity isn\'t exactly this movie\'s striving virtue , so it was a little hard to pick up . \nnot much could have really happened though . \nthe main events in this long two-hour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex , graphic drug use , extreme violence , and strong language . \nlots of explicit material is never a bad thing when there\'s a reason , but there\'s no purpose to anything in this film . \nmost of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly , while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing . \nit appears pi ? eyro ( who co-wrote with marcelo figueras , from a novel by ricardo piglia ) purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement . \nhe makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible , makes them snort cocaine , gives them guns and condoms , and lets them go . \nburnt money is pointless . \nthe performances are bad . \nit tries to thrill and shock , but only causes boredom . \ngod forbid it will ever get a distributor . \nanother disappointing film from this year\'s so-called emerging masters series . \npass on by . \n',neg
'these days , people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run . \n1970s nostalgia is already wearing off , and now , people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s . \nfew years in the future , early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia . \nhowever , i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period . \none of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon\'s loaded weapon 1 , that , in many ways , symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry - lack of originality and ideas . \nbeing made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series , this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) , burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge , and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson ) , by-the-book policeman , days away from retirement . \ntwo of them , following the murder of luger\'s ex- partner , must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner ) , crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies . \nthe authors of this films ( whose director , gene quintano , worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy ) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects , and that reflects in the lack plot , characters , and , even original lines . \nthe plot , or what goes for the plot in this movie , is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series , this film \" borrows \" its female lead from basic instinct ) . \nthe best gags , are , same as with many other similar movies , shown in the trailers . \nthe rest simply doesn\'t work . \nonly those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh . \nothers would probably wince at the lameness of humour . \nsome would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while . \nbut , at the end , spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort . \nthe film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones . \nthe authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel . \n',neg
'for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking - or what\'s left of it in mainstream hollywood - movie which are star vehicles are terrible things . \nas a rule , the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor . \nan actor might be chosen on the up-and-up , to give him exposure ; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck . \ngenerally , though , the actor doesn\'t matter , and soldier , the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers , exemplifies this : the picture lacks pizazz . \nthe star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell , otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less . \nrussell plays todd , a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought . \nthe movie lets us see this degenerate process , but by the time the real plot starts , we\'re into todd\'s later years . \nhe\'s about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers , ones who , instead of being trained * from * birth , are genetically selected * before * birth . \nthe pride of this class - caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) - will be our villain , and you know he\'s the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie\'s start . \nbetween the two leads , less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken , and it\'s possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction . \ndirector paul anderson , who helmed last year\'s icy thriller , event horizon , doesn\'t show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam . \ntodd , upon being replaced , is left to die on a garbage planet ; but in order to stretch the running time out , the villains return to the garbage planet on a \" routine patrol \" and set the stage for the final firefight . \nevents are predictable from the time that the setups are made , and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here . \nthe most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be : todd fails to show physical superiority against caine - in fact , not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie - but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry . \nit\'s not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story , and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it . \nthe best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit , and treat it as a parody of typical action fare , like universal soldier . \na strict interpretation , however , reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style , class , or substance ; and by next year , a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television . \n',neg
'some movies\' pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they\'re finally released , everyone just goes along with it . \nthus sometimes , films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations . \nlast year it was the thin red line . \nthis year\'s \" winner \" is the hurricane , pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool . \nacclaimed director norman jewison\'s biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun . \nand that\'s supposed to be ok because , see , it\'s a true story . \nit\'s about rubin \" hurricane \" carter ( denzel washington ) , a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly ( racist ! ) \ndetective ( dan hedaya ) who\'s had it in for the \" big-shot \" hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self-defense but who cares , right ? ) \nwhen rubin was only ten . \nhe is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole . \nmost of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison . \nto the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-be detectives . \nlesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well-off canadian white people ( hanna , unger , schreiber ) to get an education . \nlesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book -- \" the sixteenth round , \" rubin\'s autobiography . \nimmediately thereafter , schreiber\'s character tells lesra \" sometimes we don\'t pick the books we read , they pick us . \" \nhmmm . \nafter a few visits to the prison , they become convinced of rubin\'s innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him . \nthey meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses ( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces ? ) and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane\'s innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings . \nof course , we\'re already told that he\'s innocent . \na movie like this is especially frustrating because we\'re not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life . \nall too obviously , we\'re getting the hollywood watered- down version . \nthat would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it . \nit\'s almost cruel . \nthe melodrama isn\'t of the entertaining kind either ; it\'s the hokey , rammed-down-your-throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity . \nwitness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists . \nthe hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it\'s a no-frills courtroom movie . \nit\'s formula stripped to the bare necessities . \nyou have your wrongly accused black man . \nyou have your melodramatic final courtroom scene . \nbut there\'s nothing else . \nyou\'d expect some sort of involving investigation . \nbut that\'s not necessary since we\'re implicitly informed of his innocence . \nthus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding . \nbrooding to himself . \nbrooding to other inmates . \nbrooding to lesra . \nbrooding to lesra\'s canadian friends . \nbrooding in letters . \ni don\'t think i\'ll ever look at brooding the same way again . \nit wasn\'t long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane\'s exceedingly deep meditations on his condition . \ni wanted something to happen . \nas for washington\'s performance in the title role -- i figured i\'d have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it\'s received -- he is top notch , though still boring . \nhow is that possible ? \nwell , he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly . \nunfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap . \nwhat a waste of a great performer . \nspeaking of wastes , why the hell did john hannah agree to do this ? \nhe\'s an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly , but what is he doing here ? \nto call his character ( along with schreiber\'s and unger\'s ) a stick figure would be a gross understatement . \nall three of them come off as veritable mother theresas , as benevolent as do-gooders come . \nif they\'re to play a major part in this movie , why not make them real people , with real feelings and emotions ? \nlook : if you\'re going to make a formula movie , don\'t undermine the formula . \ncourtroom dramas can be fun , but this is ridiculous . \nnot only is it trite , it\'s boring . \n',neg

'ex-universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad . \nthe review \njean-claude van damme has a one-liner early on in universal soldier : the return , his latest attempt to remain relevant , that sums up this entire movie ; he says \" been there , done that . \" \nno film critic could possibly sum up van damme\'s recent film choices any better . \nwhile other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films ) , van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him : martial arts and guns . \nthis unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world , with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex . \nhe joins fellow martial artist/action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away . \nuniversal soldier : the return is truly poor . \nthe plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade , specifically terminator 2 : judgement day and the similarly named soldier . \nsoldier\'s kurt russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors , for the good of a planet ; schwarzenegger\'s terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine , the t-1000 ; and jean-claude , a former universal soldier , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of , you guessed it , newer model soldiers . \nconsidering the poor box office performance of soldier , it\'s amazing that this project was ever given the go-ahead . \nluc devereaux ( van damme ) was the sole remaining universal soldier ( or unisol for short ) , until he was returned to a normal , if muscular , human form . \nin this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series , following two straight-to-video duds that were ignored here plot-wise ) , luc is now a human trainer/consultant of sorts for the unisol program . \nworking with dylan cotner ( xander berkeley , who interestingly also appeared in t2 ) , the unisol program has engineered a tougher , fiercer fighting force with the help of super-computer seth . \nunfortunately , upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government , seth takes control of his soldiers , killing everyone in the building except for luc , his partner maggie , his daughter hillary and erin , a reporter trapped inside . \nthe rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive , while beating up a group of near-indestructible soldiers , most notably romeo ( popular wrestler goldberg ) . \nthere are lots of fights , gun battles , lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility . \nthere are so many clich ? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch . \nluc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on , and in the course of a single night , they go from bickering to falling for each other , to kissing . \nerin is a pathetically-written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her , and yet , not only does this not seem to frighten her , but she finds time to remind luc that she \" isn\'t leaving without her story \" . \nwhatever . \nother laughable moments include a ) luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what ? ) and b ) a group of rangers , who after having been given good advice ( luc tells them that their weapons are useless , and shows them a specific gun which should work better ) , choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway ( guess who wins the battle ? ) . \nnot one single scene in universal soldier : the return has any originality to it . \nwhen fuelled by don davis\' loud , driving music score , the film\'s many fights become almost passable , but mostly are full of the same ol\' jean-claude moves . \ndirector mic rodgers ( a former stunt co-ordinator ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace , with only a few token serious moments to be found . \nhis past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows , tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion . \nif only jean-claude weren\'t getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li , rodgers could probably have made a decent action film . \nto place the blame squarely at van damme\'s feet , however , is an injustice . \ni\'m not sure that anyone , not even robert deniro or edward norton , could make writers william malone and john fasano\'s script sound good . \none particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access . \nhe cringes , looks down and mutters \" uh . . . uhm . . . \nthey all do , i saw it on 60 minutes . \neh he he he \" the script\'s and indeed the entire film\'s only saving grace is goldberg . \nhe chews up every scene he is in , obviously enjoying his role immensely . \nhe even gives the film a few laughs , as he mutters things like \" i really don\'t like that guy \" every time he fails to kill luc . \nsadly , his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier : the return into anything better than a below-average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight-to-video . \n',neg
'starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role . \nnot that cindy does that bad , it\'s just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy\'s extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation . \nand in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i\'m sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that\'s just a happy coincidence . \nsure . \nwilliam baldwin isn\'t a bad actor . \nunfortunately , he just doesn\'t demonstrate it at all in this movie . \ni\'m not sure if that\'s because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy\'s acting look good . \nif it was the latter , it worked . \ncindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie . \nwhich is not to say that she doesn\'t have room for improvement . \nalthough to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places . \nso right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ? \nwell , i\'m glad you asked that question . \ncindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents . \nwhy woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ? \nby the end of the movie you won\'t care . \nthe story is so contrived it isn\'t funny . \nanyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin . \nwho\'s character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal\'s early films ) . \nthe point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin\'s characters of the run from these killer russians isn\'t all that bad of an idea , it\'s just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud . \nthe supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes . \nif i was baldwin , i\'d hope this film disappears . \nas for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability . \nunfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad . \nthis movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks . \nit\'s too bad they hadn\'t spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much . \nunless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you . \n',neg
'at first glance , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise . \nits plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell , desiring to take over the world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power . \nhe attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon\'s parents . \ngiven a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying father , talon vows for revenge . \neleven years later , when he\'s established his own army , the mercaneries , he vows to take back his kingdom . \nalong the way , he meets up with alana , whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell . \ntalon vows to help , and , after a series of minor escapades , eventually ends up rescuing alana\'s brother ( and several other prisoners ) , only to be captured himself ( in other words , put on a cross to be crucified ! ) . \nfortunately he frees himself , rescues alana from marrying cromwell , defeats xusia , and then cromwell , all with his triple bladed sword ( during the final battle , the blade breaks , but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade ) . \nthen , everything ends happily . \nunfortunately , the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds . \nwhat would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping , bad acting , and gruesomely gory , bloody scenes . \nnever once does the story seem to connect together , it just jumps around repeatedly . \nthis problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia . \nafter telling him that he needs his help , he leads the warlock out into daylight , but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards . \nwait a minute , didn\'t the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh-dan , which he cannot do by military force ? \nif that is the case , why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him ? \nand why does he manage to take over eh-dan anyway ? \nthese questions are just never - no , never - answered in the film . \nanother example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life , another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana\'s wedding to cromwell ( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with alana , he just tells her to \" wait \" , and then he just rides off ! \nin addition to the extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure . \neven some attempts to make it exciting , a few fire scenes , battle scenes , don\'t work . \nit just completely fails altogether miserably . \nthe only good thing about this film is its musical score , contributed by david whittaker , who had an ( extremely ) short music composing career . \nthe score is boomy and adventurous , powerful , and a billion times better than this film is . \nmy suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) . \nironically , though , before the film\'s credits roll , there is a message indicating that a sequel , tales of the ancient empire , would follow . \nto my relief ( and delight ) , it never got into production , because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office , grossing only $39 million . \ncritics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer , all right . \nleonard maltin rightfully called it \" second rate in scripting , and acting \" and at-a-glance film reviews called it \" a confusing , stupid , unimaginative , unengaging , bloodfilled bore \" . \ni totally agree with these reviews , all right , and i hope that this piece of #$\% ! \nwill be forgotten about . \nthere are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer . \ni hope you get a good laugh out of this review , but i am not laughing . \nin fact , my insults don\'t even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time . \n',neg

'the film may be called mercury rising , but that title doesn\'t describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture , a routine thriller that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated buddy story . \nthe \" hook \" that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic . \nhowever , aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance , this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device . \nthose expecting to see even a semi-thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed . \nmercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism . \nthe script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow . \ni don\'t know whether the problem is in the original book , simple simon , or in the screenplay adaptation , but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible . \nonce again , certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled , and not to good effect . \nwhile bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood , this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense . \nthe story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , art jeffries ( bruce willis ) , is confronted with his own failure . \nunable to resolve a hostage crisis in time , he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death . \nthe event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy-handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9-year old simon lynch ( miko hughes ) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player . \nsoon , art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone -- fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time , with the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player always just a step behind them . \nalong the way , they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy ( chi mcbride ) and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest ( kim dickens ) . \nwhy is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player ? \napparently , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra-secret code called \" mercury . \" \nto make sure it can\'t be cracked , they do the most intuitive thing possible : place a sample of it in a \" nerds\' puzzle magazine . \" \nof course , no one can solve it -- no one except autistic simon , that is . \nwhen he calls the phone number listed in the solution , he gets the nsa . \nas a result , the cold-hearted , sneering government man ( alec baldwin ) decides that simon has to be eliminated -- for the good of the country , of course . \nbut he hasn\'t counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , even though everyone in the audience has . \nit\'s hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn\'t do anything exceptionally well , and does quite a few things rather poorly . \nfor those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like , mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time-to-time , but even the most exciting scenes ( such as the one where art and simon are crouched down , avoiding passing trains ) aren\'t that pulse-pounding . \nthe climactic struggle is a real ho-hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness . \noverall , director harold becker is constantly struggling ( and failing ) to generate even a moment that isn\'t derivative or obligatory . \nbruce willis\' star seems to be fading . \nthis is his fourth straight lackluster outing , following last man standing , the fifth element , and the jackal . \nwillis isn\'t terrible , but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through , and often does . \nalec baldwin , combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice , does some scenery- chewing , but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace . \nthe film\'s real star is young miko hughes ( heather langenkamp\'s son in wes craven\'s new nightmare ) , who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual , but is about 50 years younger . \nmercury rising joins the likes of hard rain , the replacement killers , and u . s . marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers . \nfor those who like action and adventure in the theater , this has not been a good year . \nhopefully , the advent of summer will change that . \nuntil then , the best choices ( for bruce willis or any other action hero ) are on video . \nand , if you\'re determined to see mercury rising , check out the morning sky in early may . \n',neg
'words i thought i\'d never write : the sequel to urban legend lacks the grace , wit , and power of the original . \nput the gun to my head , pull the trigger , and put me out of my misery . \nbetter yet , put the horror genre out of its misery . \nwhen you\'ve finished watching urban legends : final cut , you\'ll share my same grim point of view thanks to the horrible acting , terrible script , and ridiculous directing which has become all too common today . \nurban legends : final cut is a smorgasbord of stolen movie ideas ( mainly from the blair witch project and scream ) : fabulous people with perfect teeth and skin , one creepy film school , and a dog eating a freshly removed kidney from one of the movie\'s hapless victims . \nurban legends delivers a story about a bunch of film students working on their thesis films to win the coveted \" hitchcock award \" which guarantees the winner a director deal in hollywood . \none female filmmaker ( jennifer morrison , the freaky dead girl from stir of echoes ) writes a fiction script based on a serial killer who kills his victims according to \" urban legend \" tales . \nsuddenly , her entire crew starts getting bumped off with urban-legendary homicides , but the bodies are always missing and she is often the only witness to the killings . \nthe killer wears a fencing mask and a long black overcoat , looking like a scorned olympian out to avenge his defeat in sydney . \nwhy this is scary is never explained . \nof course , the golden rule of sequels is that there must be least one recurring character for continuity\'s sake . \nurban legends has one minor , recurring character from the original who we never cared about anyway ( the security guard , of all people ) . \nthe other central problem is that this character has already seen the urban legend killings once before , but she\'s utterly clueless about what\'s going on around her . \ncall it suspension of disbelief . \nthis film is also a prime example of how horror films are now completely dead in the water . \nthe last decent horror film was the blair witch project , and that seemed more like a snuff film than fiction . \nthe stalking killer with crazy motivation has become a tired clich ? , as everyone seems to have forgotten : real horror is not about what is seen but about what is unknown . \n',neg
'absolute power , the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood , attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff . \nit is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper . \none can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood . \nnot only is the plot unbelievable and contrived , but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence . \ncontinually underestimating the audience , the film gives us information we already know or dont even need . \ndetails essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying ( like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night-vision goggles in their car ? ) . \noddly enough , the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities . \na masterful jewel-thief ( played by clint eastwood ) witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire ( played by e . g . \nmarshall ) . \nwhile robbing one of marshalls mansions , he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault . \nthere , through a two-way mirror , he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay . \ntheir game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman . \nin self defense , the woman grabs a letter-opener and stabs the man in the elbow . \nshe raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men . \nthe man ? \nhe is the president of the united states of america . \nwhere does the film go wrong ? \nit cannot be the acting . \nclint eastwood , ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type-cast , but decent performances . \nthe cinematography is sufficient ; wild and erratic during action sequences , dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes , and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue . \neven the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre . \nthe fault clearly lies in the screenplay , and the screenplay alone . \nwhile setting up a story about misuse of power , about the true possessors of that power , and about intrigue and double-crossing , it does not resolve it . \nnot one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax . \nrather , the tense situations are left dangling at the end , giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness . \nan example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene : in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood , the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant . \npolice officers are everywhere , incognito of course . \nat the same time , not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives . \nall three parties are unaware of each others presence . \nthis scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood , who might suspect this is a trap , will get himself out of this difficult position . \nhe will probably have a brilliant plan , involving ingenious preparations . \nhowever , when he arrives at the trap , both hit men miss ( how convenient ) and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away . \nthe buildup of this scene took about ten minutes . \nten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap . \nthe scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds . . . \nparallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter . \nthe daughter blames her father for never being there for her , because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere . \nof course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family . \nagain , it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot . \nhowever , trying is simply not enough ! \nthe second story line should be subtle , original and preferably unpredictable . . . \neverything this film is not . \nhow could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced ? \nhow could eastwood , who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven , ever believe in a project like this one ? \ni am sad to say that my respect for the actor/director/producer has diminished substantially due to this film . \ndirector quentin tarantino once said : \" i can make a good movie out of any bad script . \" \ndirector clint eastwood obviously cannot . \n',neg

'in the continuation of warner brother\'s franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow . \nwhat makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film . \navika goldsman\'s screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another . \nthis coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as \" the client \" is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke . \nsituations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another . \nthis is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone\'s batgirl , who just happens to be alfred\'s niece . \nthe story of dr

and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment . \nnow of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live . \nnow the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me . \nif mr . freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth . \nthis is indeed a cold hearted man . \nthe development of poison ivy is no less contradictory . \nshe wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal . \nshe joins with mr .

dialogue given him . \nto say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous . \nhis best performances are still on \" e . r . \" . \nbruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his

, except for a boy around the age of 15 . \nhis later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest , even though they are not related in a traditional sense . \nchris o\'donnell , once considered a rising star , successfully burns up on reentry with this performance . \nhis robin needs nothing more than a good spanking . \nthe less said about alicia silverstone\'s performance the better . \nthis talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film . \nshe was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it . \nthis brings us to the villains

only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough . \nthese two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film . \nwithout going through the intricacies of the plot , there is one question that always comes to mind with this series ( except for the first \" batman \" ) , and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel . \nmr . freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video . \nevery villain ( even the minor ones ) have to have a look , no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume . \nwith this film , warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it\'s tv incarnation . \nthe only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows ! , \ngwaaaa\'s , and clang\'s associated with the old series .

'while i am not fond of any writer\'s use of cheap , easy puns , i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it ( witness my review of _pecker_ from a couple of issues ago ) . \nso here goes : the juvenile , college-set black comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival . \nstrait-laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout ) \'s blemish-free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate , cooper ( mark-paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze-filled nights that come with university life . \nwith the threat of losing an academic scholarship ( josh ) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming ( cooper ) , what are two good-hearted slackers to do ? \neasy--look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student\'s ( or students\' ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as . \nso instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends . \ndirector alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper\'s diabolical plot . \nuntil then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar\'s sitcom-bred mugging . \nthat said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it . \nthe introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) . \none wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for . \nnot surprisingly , he does resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty . \nthe same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ . \nwhatever morbid appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self-absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get-go . \n_dead_man_ doesn\'t grow tiresome ; it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through . \nas it slogs along to a cheesy , happy-for-all-parties conclusion , _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on . . . \nlike a zombie . \n',neg
'boy , what a great movie ! ! \nkeanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together , the director of the fugitive ( andrew davis ) back again to give us another thriller , and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot . \nhow could this not be a blockbuster ? \nall die-hard keanu reeves fans , read on . \nol \" much ado about nothing \" plays eddie kasalivich , a machinist studying at the university of chicago . \nto help pay for the rent , he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university . \nby happy coincidence , he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics . \nthis project holds great promise : taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in . \na potential solution to the earth\'s energy problems without the pollution cost . \nsurely nobody could have any problems with that ? \nmorgan freeman is paul shannon , the project\'s sponsor . \nhe works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public . \nhe figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly . \nso he murders the project leader , blows up the project ( great but short scene here , sort of like a mini id4 city-devastation thing ) and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi-tech hush-hush location . \nunfortunately , our intrepid machinist and an english physicist ( weisz ) manage to get away and now follows a fugitive-like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script . \nthis movie is just dying for a comparison with \" the fugitive \" . \nboth movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn\'t change much , i guess we can\'t really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere . \nthe trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones , chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward . \ncredit to them , but we aren\'t really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters . \nwhere ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy , eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves\' character is never given the time to develop . \nit might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences , which frankly , get quite boring after a while . \nharrison ford was \" the man against the world . \" \nhe was alone in a world where he didn\'t know who to trust and it came across real well . \nin chain reaction , keanu reeves isn\'t alone . \nnow that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia , vulnerability and confusion . \nwe don\'t get this . \nwe get him thinking he\'s still in speed , only now our sandra bullock has an english accent , probably doesn\'t drive a bus , and hardly contributes anything to the movie . \nthe producers here probably thought , \" hey , what if keanu and rachel don\'t hit it off too well ? \nlet\'s rope in that morgan to help us out . \" \nwell , keanu and rachel didn\'t hit it off well on the screen , and most unfortunately , morgan freeman doesn\'t help much either . \nthe only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder . \nit\'s not really his fault . \nonce again , andrew davis just doesn\'t take the time to build his characters . \nsomeone must have convinced him that this time round , cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken . \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n',neg
'please don\'t mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam . . . i \njust want to warn all of y\'all not to waste your hard-earned $$$ on anaconda . \nit\'s not even worth a 99-cent video rental . \ndon\'t listen to ebert on this one ( he has no clue what he\'s talking about ! ) \nbtw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was * required * to watch it on assignment ( she reviews movies for a local paper ) . \nnow i\'ll actually back up my huffing and puffing . \nhere goes : \nmovie : anaconda rydain\'s bottom line : wait for it to come on usa up all night . \neven then , i doubt it\'s worth the price of jolt ( to help you stay up that late ! ) \nwhy do i hate anaconda ? \nlet me count the ways . . . \nfirst of all , this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong . \nas an ophiophile ( snake lover ) , i can tell you that a ) anacondas would never reach a length of 40 feet , b ) they\'re scared of people , c ) cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake\'s mouth , and constrictor snakes don\'t kill what they can\'t eat , d ) people can outrun snakes with no trouble , especially heavy ones like anacondas , e ) if an anaconda did eat a human , it would need at least 6 months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal , therefore it couldn\'t run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast , and f ) snakes have no vocal cords , so they can\'t make funny squealing noises . \nwhew . \ni was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it . \nunfortunately , anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel . \nmy friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end . \nanybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually . \nthat was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn\'t give up and fall asleep . \nhe was the most likable character in the movie . \nwho wouldn\'t enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman ? \nanaconda did have its cute moments : arguments between ice cube\'s character and the british guy , for instance . \nhowever , those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twenty-eight minutes of boring schlock . \nthe writers had - and blew - a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines . \ni was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny . \ndid she retort with a clever , ego-withering comeback ? \nof course not ! \n \" i\'m trying to work ! \" \ngee , that\'s even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with . \nshe could have told him to go find a knothole or something . . . \n ; p but i will admit , there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome ( hint : it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks ) . \nas for the plot , i\'m still trying to find one . \nthis movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous , computer-generated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the faster-than-gravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet . \n ( harrier snake ? ) \nnot to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims . \nthe writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist ( should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense ? ) in which the sick guy\'s g-friend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him . \nthat was about as clear and understandable as mission : impossible . \n ( if someone could explain that movie to me , i\'d be most grateful ! \nall the old-guy double agents looked the same ! ! ) \ni wasn\'t inspired by the acting , save for the evil dude . \ni can\'t blame the actors , though . \nit\'s not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with . \nthis concludes rydain\'s diatribe on a shameless exploitation ( and perpetuation ! ) of public fear of snakes . \ncomments , flames , anyone ? \n-rydain the atomic cheese , fresh from chernobyl dairies ! \n',neg
'man , this was one wierd movie . \nsimilar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn\'t decide which genre it is . \nthe first hour is your standard stock aliens clone , which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship . \nthe last half hour ? \nthis was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided - \" screw it , let\'s just kill everybody \" . \nfrom then on - forget sci-fi . . . this \nmovie becomes 100\% horror . \nwhat really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way . \ninstead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare - this movie just uses loud noises , sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore . . . . . yawn . . . . everyone\'s \nseen it all before and knows when to expect it . \nthe one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew . \nthere are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed , but what did this ? \nthen finally after being painfully restored - the new crew views the video . \nthe acting isn\'t too bad at all . . . . . considering what the actors had to work with anyway , as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of . \nthere was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though , like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space . \nthis movie could have been so much better . \nit had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with . \nthere was just nothing new here that any of us haven\'t seen before in aliens or hellraiser . \n',neg
'synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion . \nreluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate . \ncomments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies . \nshe proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner . \nthe clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title . \nnot even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese . \nit\'s so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it\'s oddly fascinating . \nthe ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out . \nthe clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel . \nto this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following . \ni remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother . \ni have never read this book , but i sure hope it\'s 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation . \nif not , then i\'m at a complete loss to explain its popularity . \nthe clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene . \na young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e . t . , \ntramps about in the woods . \nwith her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience\'s expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered . \nwhat follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla\'s mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er , \nleggings ) . \ntearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera . . . well , \nas the earthquake slowly recedes . \na hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven . \ni won\'t detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point . \nthis movie is really stupid . \nit never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief . \nalso , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston . \nthe movie doesn\'t just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four . \na blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs . \nshe\'s of the \" new people \" ; they\'re of the \" old people \" with \" the memories . \" \nyep . \nwe get it . \nwe get it . \nthe clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me . \nthe movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing . \nas stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time . \nthe rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt . \nthe face-painting that\'s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind . \nthis movie also suffers from its new age trappings . \nmaybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music . \nadd to this the film\'s faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you\'d expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious . \nthe clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it\'s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i\'ve seen in quite a while . \nit contains several scenes of sex sans nudity . \nthe violence mostly consists of hunting scenes . \nthe funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear . \nthe bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about . \nalthough this may sound gratuitous , i\'m sure , it\'s so cheesy that it probably won\'t bother most people . \nthe clan of the cave bear is a bad movie . \nhowever , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality . \ntypically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind . \nthe clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it\'s so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) . \ni have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i\'m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie . \ni shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . . \n',neg
'salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets . \nactors who demand such salaries might be greedy , but in some instances they are quite justified , because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation . \nproof for that can be found even in the realm of low-budget movies , and one fine example is breakaway , 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring ( in ) famous figure skater tonya harding . \nface of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie\'s poster , but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra , attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster . \none day she decides to retire , but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that . \nrealising that her life suddenly became worthless , myra starts running for her life , followed by professional assassins . \nterri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater . \nalthough tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities , her acting leaves much to be desired . \non the other hand , her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality , believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b-films a bad name . \nmartin sheen\'s brother joe estevez , whose character looks like he had entered from another movies\' set , is the only bright spot of breakaway . \nunfortunately , he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding\'s silver screen debut proved to be her last film . \n',neg
'the kids in the hall are an acquired taste . \nit took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer . \nmaybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies , they would grow into the big screen . \nmy recommendation is that , unless you are a big fan of the kids , skip the film . \nas it is , their first--and most likely only--attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv . \na big-budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show . \nthe kids go through the motions , but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so . \nand this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics . \nbrain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression . \nin typical sketch-comedy tradition , each actor plays several roles . \ndoctor cooper ( kevin mcdonald ) and his team create the drug . \nthen , under pressure from don roritor ( mark mckinney ) , founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals , dr . cooper releases the drug into the marketplace . \nthe ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film . \nat about 90 minutes , brain candy still seems long . \nthe best thing about sketch comedy--and the kids are no exception--is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs , then go on to another quick skit . \nbut with the additional set-up necessary in telling a longer , coherent story , the laughs just dont come fast enough . \nstrangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv . \nthe movie makes several attempts at risqueness--mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters--but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating . \none of the best bits , though , does make use of thompsons naked buttocks ; we see him charging into battle--going to have sex with some guys taking a shower . \nin the classic of this genre , monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail . \nthe kids , unfortunately , are not up to the task . \nthere are some amusing moments , to be sure , but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one . \n',neg
' \" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams\' now infamous score . \ndah-dum . \nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \nperhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . \nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams\' music . \nhe\'s building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark\'s arrival is truly terrifying . \nhe doesn\'t let us get bored with the imagery . \nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn\'t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn\'t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it\'s a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . \nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \n \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it\'s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . \neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock\'s \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what\'s right and going against the entire town . \n \" it\'s your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . \ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie\'s captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \nhe\'s slightly deranged , and shaw\'s performance is almost a caricature . \nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \nof course , we can\'t leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind\'s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . \nevery one of spielberg\'s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \nthe shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \nmany have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie\'s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \n',pos
'i\'ve noticed something lately that i\'ve never thought of before . \npseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films . \nhave you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ? \nmore and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff . \ni\'m not trying to say city of angels is that bad . \nit had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered . \nsomehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography . \nthe predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment . \nbut for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time . \nnicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life . \nmeg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we\'re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive . \nafter losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient\'s transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor . \nhe begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday . \nangels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire . \nseth\'s adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community . \nthe angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it\'s a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness . \ncage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once . \nit\'s nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire . \nthe two aren\'t very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual \" intelligently ditzy \" romantic comedy roles , and it\'s an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy . \nbut even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye . \nit\'s a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn\'t know quite how to get to it . \nthey struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high . \nfilmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths . \nbased on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending . \nmost movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized . \nnonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories . \n',pos
'a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! \n>from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters . \n1996\'s the cable guy was supposed to be his big \" breakthrough \" role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting . \nas most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar . \nnot only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics . \nas far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it . \nthe first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn\'t really like it . \nhowever , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i\'ve had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film . \nand to my surprise , it grew on me . \nthe plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship . \nsee , steven\'s been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn\'t think he has any more room in his life for a new friend . \nalso , some of the cable guy\'s antics have been creeping him out . \ncarrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn\'t enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done . \nfor me , its not the movie as a whole that\'s enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven\'s apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few . \nperhaps the fact that more of carrey\'s humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny . \nand if you really want to see something , you\'ve got to hear his version of jefferson airplane\'s \" somebody to love \" , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam . \nthe cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie . \ni didn\'t particularly like steven\'s girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend . \nalso , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing . \nstill , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you\'re at the video store and can\'t think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out . \nor if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you won\'t have to wait long . ) \nhell , that\'s what i do every day . \n',pos
'hilarious , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o\'halloran and jeff anderson ) . \nthey spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment . \nthe premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film\'s budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this . \noriginally rated nc-17 for language . \nnot recommended for viewers with sensitive ears . \nkilling zoe =========== \nremake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you\'re halfway to killing zoe , writer/director roger avary\'s slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery . \neric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers . \nhe\'s the safecracker who\'s blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go . \nthough intriguing on all fronts , the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction , which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino . \nin english and french . \nthe road to wellville ===================== \nbased on the novel by t . coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn\'t go very far . \nbowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr . john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900\'s , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation . \nhe also invented the cornflake . \nreally . \nchecking-in to kellogg\'s battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda , just two of the many well-known faces in this failed comedy . \nleave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack , michael lerner , lara flynn boyle , john neville , and dana carvey . \nthe art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing , but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama . \nwhat he ends up with is something that i can\'t print here . \nphew ! \nstargate ======== \nlawrence of arabia meets star wars . \nthis epic sci-fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else . \ndirector roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on . \nthe film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history . \nthat said , there\'s still plenty to watch here . \nsci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader . \nhe plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that \" somebody else \" built the pyramids . \nless interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame . \nstar trek generations ===================== \ntrek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best . \nthe story is interesting , but each scene goes too long . \nthe cast is earnest , but the direction lacks punch . \nand so on . \n ( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii . ) \noriginal enterprise captain james t . kirk appears on both ends of the story , though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead \" get a life . \" \nremarkably unremarkable . \nmiracle on 34th street ====================== \nin a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al , maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street * is * necessary . \njohn hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original . \nthe romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn\'t work too well , but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle . \nhis chemistry with children can moisten any eye . \nno claus for alarm . \njunior ====== \narnold schwarzenegger pregnant ? \nsure , billy crystal did it before in rabbit test , but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie . \nwhat should be nothing more than a one-joke premise actually gets better as it goes along . \ndirector ivan reitman ( dave , twins ) wisely keeps the farce to a minimum , so the first hour moves slower than you might expect . \ndon\'t expect too many yuks from danny devito , but you can\'t beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie . \nhow\'s * that * for a collision of acting styles ? \n',pos
'for those of us who weren\'t yet born when the 1960\'s rock \'n\' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies . \nfrom otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy . \nbut i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves . \nshot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . \nsure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a . \npennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience . \nno matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul . \nthe excitement starts before the music even begins . \na young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so . \nthere are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick . \nand when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , \" finally , a decent sound system ! \" \nyou can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn\'t about vanity , it\'s about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street . \nthis interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience . \nit\'s impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain . \nand while the lyrics to \" wild thing \" may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love . \neven if you don\'t recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats . \nthe only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal . \nall the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time . \nin contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time . \nfor a film that\'s only 78 minutes long , that\'s too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating . \nall in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us . \nthe variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in . \nif there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled . \nit\'s almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn\'t get made much anymore . \ninstead we\'re stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling . \n',pos
'as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . \nthe shot has tibbs\' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . \nto see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . \nas a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin . \nthe bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . \nthis one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds . \nit perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film . \n \" in the heat of the night \" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america . \njewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental . \nin these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers . \nhe is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present . \npreceding the very original \" a soldier\'s story \" and the recently released \" the hurricane , \" \" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters . \nthe film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted . \ntibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him . \nas a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist . \npoitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character . \nnever nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing . \nhowever , unlike \" the hurricane \" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance . \nas a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role . \nhe starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople . \nhe would refer to tibbs as \" boy \" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him . \nas the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff . \nhe begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors . \nwhat i really enjoyed about steiger\'s character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film . \nhe still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil . \ninstead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future . \nmost movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes . \nthis action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day . \njewison\'s determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate . \n \" in the heat of the night \" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960\'s . \nit displays this perfectly . \nhowever , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest . \nit seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim . \nthere were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) . \nalso , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered . \nthe rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic . \n ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson . \nhe managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , \" in the heat of the night \" and the even better \" in cold blood . \" ) \n',pos
'the event of events is upon us . \npeople have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . \ni don\'t think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . \nit is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . \nanyone who tells you \" it\'s just a movie \" is either lying or clueless . \nit is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . \nthe second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . \nbut that does not mean that the film itself is bad . \nin fact , it is terrific . \ni strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . \nit is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . \nthe film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . \nthe republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as \" the force \" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . \nunable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . \non the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie\'s real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \nhe is an innocent slave boy , but \" the force is strong with him \" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . \nas any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . \n>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor\'s movie . \naround 70\% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . \ni think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . \nthis is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . \nhe\'s essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like \" exqueeze me ? \" \nand \" mesa go now , okeday ? \" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . \nthe visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . \nif it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . \nthe climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn\'t already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term \" popcorn movie \" . \nwhat made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams . \neven though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . \nhis use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . \nthe phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . \nwhen you see \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away \" , when the familiar music plays , when the words \" star wars \" appear on screen , you\'ll feel a tingle even if you didn\'t see the movie when it first came out in \'77 . \nit feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . \nit is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . \nwe not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we\'re seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . \nthe phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . \nit works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n',pos
'if there\'s one thing in common about all of hollywood\'s major studios , it\'s that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . \nalthough twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it\'s obvious there\'s no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . \nso when a movie like gary ross\' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it\'s a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . \nalthough the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . \nquite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . \nthe story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . \nnot in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross\' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . \nkudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . \nit stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named \" pleasantville . \" \nmaguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . \nit\'s not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . \nsoon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . \nat one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . \nwalsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . \nfine performances are turned in all around . \nmaguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . \nwalsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . \ndaniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman\'s envy . \nfor daniels , it\'s his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it\'s a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . \nalso of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . \nthere\'s not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don\'t . \n',pos
'at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . \nthat\'s true of home alone 2 and i\'d bet money that it\'s true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . \nbut home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn\'t get in the way . \nthe mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays . \nfour adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . \nthe littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids\' cruelty . \nkevin\'s patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he\'s going to have to starve . \nhe attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him . \nthe fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle . \nthe knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . \nnobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back . \nthe ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o\'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night . \non his way up the stairs , he tells her that \" families suck \" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again . \nthat night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . \nin a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him . \nit\'s interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . \nfirst they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . \nthey\'re two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . \nmeanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true . \nhe\'s finally rid of his family ! \nlife is a dream come true . \nhe can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother\'s secret box . \nslowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane . \nhe grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( \" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener \" ) . \nhe also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring . \nthe furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house . \nmacaulay culkin is cute but he isn\'t much of an actor . \nstill , we can see that kevin\'s character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing . \nfor example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as \" santa \" is getting in his car . \nkevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . \nhe learned how to deal with the furnace . \nyou turn on the lights and it\'s not so scary anymore . \nhe goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man . \nthey talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid . \nfinally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) . \nthis last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie\'s genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert . \nit\'s a lot of fun , and it doesn\'t overwhelm the rest of the movie . \non the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie . \njohn williams\' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . \nbut it does have its flaws . \nthe smallest problem is that culkin doesn\'t act very well . \nas i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin\'s insight into his character . \nthe biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin\'s life about five times . \ninstead of \" i\'m gonna get that kid \" they say \" i\'m gonna kill that kid . \" \nsome might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree . \nmixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . \ni\'ll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . \ndon\'t let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick . \n',pos

'every year , hollywood crowns a new \" it boy \" --a young actor pegged for major movie stardom . \ninheriting the mantle from last year\'s \" winner , \" matthew mcconaughey , is matt damon , and , like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face , as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham\'s the rainmaker and good will hunting . \ndamon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--in this case , francis ford coppola\'s take on the rainmaker . \ndamon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor , who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company . \nwhile rudy\'s ( and the film\'s ) main concern is this case , he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role ) . \nwritten for the screen and directed by coppola , the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously . \ncoppola\'s most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself , which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy\'s unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company\'s hotshot attorney ) . \nthe inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous , but danes is as superb as always . \nthen , of course , there is damon , who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy\'s often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat . \nas good as he is in the rainmaker , damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting , directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself . \ndamon plays the title character , will hunting , a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius . \nin an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction , an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend , community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , to counsel the abrasive , standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life . \ngood will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests , but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon\'s intelligent script touches . \neven though no one ( and , if so , _very_ few people ) can directly relate to will\'s burden of superhuman intelligence , the insecurities he suffers are universal . \nthe material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors . \nwilliams delivers a nice dramatic turn ; affleck , a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy ) , turns up in a warm and charming performance as will\'s best friend ; and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as will\'s harvard-schooled love interest . \nthe clear standout in the cast , though , is damon , who bravely does not soften will\'s prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him . \nso many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine , but based on his impressive work in john grisham\'s the rainmaker and especially good will hunting , it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come . \n',pos
'up until about a year ago , john travolta\'s career consisted of those \" look who\'s talking \" movies ( notice how they never called them look who\'s talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) . \nbut somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again . \nweird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named \" size isn\'t everything \" ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) . \nbut now travolta\'s back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why . \nfour words : contract with the devil . \nand this has nothing to do with newt gingrich\'s \" contract with america . \" \nno , satan is much more humane . \nanyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld . \nhow do i know ? \ni own the document in question . \namazing what you can buy at those collector\'s shops for a few hundred dollars , isn\'t it ? \nget shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer . \nhe goes to collect some of the mafia\'s money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game . \nsure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that\'s beside the point . \npalmer is determined to get hackman\'s next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito . \nit doesn\'t take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from \" who\'s the boss ? \" \nto speechless . \nit works in this case , unlike \" who\'s the boss ? \" \nalthough it\'s interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also . \ncomplicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman\'s other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta\'s mob boss trying to track him down for defecting . \nget shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities . \nthis movie doesn\'t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i\'ve seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) . \nget shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence . \ni\'m definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on . \nare you getting this , shorty ? \n',pos
'roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor . \nhowever the emperor\'s evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father before the announcement can be made , and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed . \nmaximus is able to escape his executioners , but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed ) . \nproximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself ) , and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator . \nwhen emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum , proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle . \nmaximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus . \ngladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required \" 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence \" style of moviemaking . \nthe only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used . . . \nit\'s choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting . \nit\'s similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan , but nowhere near as effective . \nthe actual gladiator battles are thrilling , but also a bit disjointed . \nmany times it\'s unclear as to exactly what\'s going on . . . \nall the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled . \nwe\'re not sure who\'s blood or by who\'s hand though . \nthere\'s an instance of this earlier in the film too that\'s disappointing . \nit\'s comes when maximus escapes his executioners . \nsome flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free . . . \nbut i still don\'t know exactly how he did it . \nrussell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995\'s virtuosity . \nfor whatever reason his stardom never arrived . . . \nbut he should have it now . \nfrom here on moviegoers should now be able to say , \" let\'s go see the new russell crowe movie \" . \nhe gets the best scene in the film ( and one of the best moments of all recent movies ) when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum . \nit\'s both rousing and chilling . \njoaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character ( which could have easily happened ) . \ncommodus is conniving , sneaky and whiny , but phoenix never lets the character get silly . \nit\'s a very good ( and very creepy ) performance . \noliver reed died during the filming of gladiator , and it\'s a huge loss to the acting world . \ni\'ve always been fascinated with reed . . . \nhe\'s one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years . \nit\'s ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again , as he gives a fun and sincere performance . \nthe film is dedicated to him , and he will surely be missed . \nreed\'s death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem , as he still had scenes to be completed . \nrather than recast the role ( and end up reshooting a great deal of footage ) , a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars . \nironically , that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film . \nanyway , this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of ( for about twenty seconds ) and if you aren\'t looking for it you won\'t even be able to tell . \nsome of the other digital effects are less convincing however . . . \nand like i always say , noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately . \nit\'s sad that such a good film has these distractions . \nmovies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects . \nkeep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events , but is entirely a work of fiction . \nhowever it\'s a work of fiction that\'s great entertainment , and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a . d . \n',pos
'you\'ve seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing . \nthe difference is that when it happens to lili taylor\'s nell in the haunting , we don\'t care . \nthe hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike . \nthe seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom . \ndesperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ) , malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) . \nthe preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm\'s would-be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret . \nonly after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine-tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time . \nmalcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole\'s anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures . \nhe will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process . \nthe sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist . \n ( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . ) \nit\'s far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks . \ncole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they\'re not out to harm him , really-they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler . \nperhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we\'re looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old . \nthat\'s right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar . \nwe appreciate malcolm\'s domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed . \nboth actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest . \nwillis convinces us that he\'s a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night . \nosment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do . \nthe sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs\' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading . \nonly because i was expecting something different did i notice-rather , feel-the movie\'s running time , which is just shy of two hours . \nthe story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait . \ni\'m not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity . \n',pos
'hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest ) . \nit\'s a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters . \ni mean , come on . \nare people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ? \nhell no . \nand not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films . \nand not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk \'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either . \nthis is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu . \ni got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays . \nand that is exactly what this film is ; art . \ni\'ve been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers . \nlet me backtrack a minute . \nwhen i say \" intellectual ground \" , i don\'t mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved . \nwith most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown . \nthose movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen . \nyou see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore . \nthis is a thinking man\'s slasher flick . \nthe \" nosferatu \" of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy . \nhe employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder ) . \nupon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock\'s castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter\'s ) . \nthe next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck . . . not \nreally a good sign . \nhe then discovers through some reading that the count is a \" nosferatu \" , or vampire , one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans . \nbut by the time he pieces this together , he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutter\'s hometown via boat . \nwill hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ? \nthe character of orlock is , of course , dracula . \nthe only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker\'s novel . \njust thought that was an interesting little side note . . . \nprobably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment\'s digitally restored cut , now available in stores . \nhowever , this version is quite different than maunau\'s original masterpiece . \nthe movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o-negative and color tinting , much like the 1984 version of lang\'s metropolis . \nnow , i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here , bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one . \nbut alas , i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen . \nbut that\'s just my bag ; you may like the newer , more \" modern \" version better . \neither way , i suggest investing your money in a copy . \nif you like what they have done with it , pop it in the vcr and enjoy . \nif you\'re like me , just do what i\'ll do during future viewings ; turn the color all the way down on your television , hit mute , turn on some bach or mozart or whatever , dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made . \n',pos
'screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker . \nscreenplay by andrew kevin walker . \ninspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving . \ndirected by tim burton . \nstarring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien . \nspecial appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken . \nsynopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation . \ntownspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them . \ncute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery . \ncomments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years . \nbatman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels . \nhe\'s done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children\'s movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) . \nsleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies . \nsleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios\' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international\'s series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe . \nchristopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders . \nthe movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s . \none of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein . \ni mention these allusions for a reason . \nseasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film . \nwith the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this . \nnot only does it have a sense of history , but burton\'s skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror . \nthe film\'s eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie . \njohnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving\'s original story and is now an investigator . \ndepp is adequate in his role . \nno more ; no less . \nequally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film . \nshe\'s a good witch too . \nhow cute . \none of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters . \nthe two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine . \nveteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers . \nwhile i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing . \nyou have to pay attention . \nandrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay . \nhe\'s the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven . \nwalker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn\'t hurt his growing reputation . \nas one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic . \nthere\'s a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings . \nthis is definately not a flick to take the young kids to . \na lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest\'s eyes with her hand . \nhe was obviously upset by the movie\'s intense violence . \nif you\'re looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended . \n',pos

'blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood\'s premier leading men . \nblade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it . \nit is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well . \nalthough , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie . \nthe ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story . \nbut at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once . \nthat really doesn\'t take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit . \nblade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire . \nhis mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire . \nincluding a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust . \nblade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother . \nbut this isn\'t as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade\'s world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films . \nthe government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires . \nwhere do vampires get money ? \nwell , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations . \ni personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie . \nblade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community . \nhe isn\'t content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority . \nhe has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable . \nit\'s up to blade to see that this doesn\'t transpire . \nadmittedly , blade is style over substance through and through . \nthe story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less . \nthe acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type . \nthis isn\'t a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this . \nthe movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise . \nit\'s a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise . \nblade\'s production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster . \nthe combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done . \nalthough , the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences . \nblade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre . \nthis is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle . \nwhat blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life . \nvery cool . \n',pos
'after having heard so many critics describe \" return to me \" as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? \nwhat made \" return to me \" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? \nwas it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? \nwas it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? \nthe charisma of the two leads ? \neven now i can\'t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven\'t see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances . \ni don\'t think any of the romances i\'ve seen have been classified as such . \nwhich leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- \" return to me \" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider . \nit was traditional , magical . \nwe knew it couldn\'t be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in . \nit was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn\'t help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings . \nthe film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt\'s direction . \nfrom the very first bird\'s eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the \" return to me \" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we\'re in for something sweet . \nthe scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy . \nreal people don\'t act that way ; real people aren\'t that nice . \nwe know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks\' existence . \nthe premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt\'s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal . \neverything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film . \n>from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob\'s wardrobes . \nfrom the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints . \nfrom the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part . \n \" return to me \" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist . \nwe care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we\'re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father . \nwhatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors . \ndisappointingly , david alan grier\'s charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written . \nduchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder . \ninstead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of \" the x-files . \" \nduchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen . \nminnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer . \nthough an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses . \nwhile \" return to me \" functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop . \nthe entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife\'s heart . \nwe already know that there\'s going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point . \nas a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes , i know she\'s supposed to have his ex-wife\'s heart and everything--it seems too effortless . \nthe main subject is a love story , and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) . \nhowever , in the spirit of \" return to me , \" it won\'t do to be too picky about how \" old \" hollywood tells its stories . \ni loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt . \nit shows . \nthe bottom line : \" return to me \" is nothing remarkable , and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn\'t imagined . \n',pos
'wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal . \nthe setting of the film is a town named blue bay . \nit consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town\'s different benefactors . \nthe film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town\'s ritzy , expensive high school . \nit is here that we meet all of the core characters . \nthere\'s guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan . \nwe first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly . \nthroughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape . \nshortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well . \nthis pushes kelly\'s sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted . \nduring the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her . \nhowever , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor . \nafter sam is cleared , kelly\'s mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her . \nit is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together . \nit is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda . \nmatt dillon stars as sam lombardo . \nsam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage . \nhe isn\'t the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance . \nhowever , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place . \nneve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller . \nsuzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film . \ncampbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch . \nplaying kelly van ryan is denise richards . \nkelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra . \none of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother . \ndenise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film . \nin the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well . \nkevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette . \nthis character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film . \nhowever , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story . \nstill , the film doesn\'t seem to gain much from bacon\'s performance , only his name . \nin the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan , daphne rubin-vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez , and bill murray shines as sam\'s lawyer , ken bowden . \nhats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film . \nalthough wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller , the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters . \nthis is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it\'s share of twists . \n',pos
'accepting his oscar as producer of this year\'s best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over . \none could almost say the same about his much-prized film . \nrarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth . \nin short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . \nyet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . \nralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . \nbut despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him . \nhis emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld . \nthe same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many . \njuliette binoche\'s nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart . \nat least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger . \neven this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical . \nwith so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film\'s 160 minutes can be taxing . \nyet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn\'t help but feel that greatness was in the air . \nhints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war . \nthere is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years . \nbut ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed . \nin the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore . \nbore is perhaps too strong a word . \nbut after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full . \n',pos
'everyone knows someone like giles de\'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with \" progress . \" \ngiles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis . \nhis house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he\'s living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth . \nthis is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns \" erstwhile fogy \" giles into a three-dimensional human being . \ndespite his tunnel vision , it\'s impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love . \nand , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it\'s possible to find the object of one\'s affection in the most unusual places . \ngiles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go . \nwhat he doesn\'t realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii . \na nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress . \njust as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it\'s love at first sight . \ngiles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes . \n ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn\'t realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . ) \neventually , not satisfied with being the world\'s foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol\'s home is located . \nbostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie\'s supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) . \neventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles\' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man\'s advice . \nbut , while giles\' affection runs deep , ronnie\'s feelings are less constant . \nlove and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that . \nin fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect . \nit suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it . \nin his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100\% on- target . \nin the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited . \nfrom start to finish , this is clearly hurt\'s movie ? he\'s in almost every frame . \nit\'s a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions . \njason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie . \nhe is charismatic , and it\'s not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie . \nmeanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin . \nlove and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a \" fish out of water \" tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) . \nyet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots . \nit has a vibrant , beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile . \n',pos

'james l . brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this entertaining , if slightly flawed comedy . \nnicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen . \nhe\'s racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone . \nso , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t . v \nsitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 ) . \nnaturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end . \nlike good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy . \nnicholson is hilarious as melvin , churning out insults with superb relish . \nonly nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers . \nhunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson . \nthere\'s also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them . \nkinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he\'s more of a plot convience than a character . \nalthough his performance is good , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together . \nin fact , the scene stealer is simon\'s dog , who is funnier than nicholson . \nbut then again , pets are always cute on screen . \nproviding solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn\'t as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun . \nhe overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying . \nsmith is also good , although she has a fairly small role . \neven director lawrence kasdan ( body heat , 1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor . \nbut this is primarily nicholsons film , and every scene he\'s in , he\'s steals it . \nhe\'s character is so hateful , though , it\'s amazing that anyone talks to him at all , especially carol . \nand this is the films main problem . \nit\'s totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin . \nshe doesn\'t fall in love with him naturally , the film forces her to fall in love with him . \nalso , melvins character seems to go too nice , too quickly . \ni would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice , loving person . \nit would take a helluva long time , much longer than this film would like to make out . \nbrooks direction is good , though , if a bit average , but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience . \nhe handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally he\'s good . \nthere\'s also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer . \nbut , generally , as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do , which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie . \nthe movie is a bit overlong , but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly . \noverall , as good as it gets is a fun movie , even though it may be unbelivable , and certainly worth seeing ( if just for jack nicholsons performance . ) \nnot quite as good as it gets ( pardon the bad joke ) , but still good fun . \n',pos
'i think that any competent member of the human race who\'s ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer . \neven though i try very hard to not predict films as i\'m watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen . \nbut i don\'t care . \nnot even a little . \nmy reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great . \n2 ) drew barrymore is great . \n3 ) the movie is so funny . \nthere are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard . \ni haven\'t laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers . \nsandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music . \nin the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother\'s wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness . \na week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) . \nwith his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress . \nshe is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months . \njulia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans . \nsoon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other . \noh sure , it\'s trite . \nand if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience . \nwhat makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances . \nbarrymore is simply adorable here ( i\'ve never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) . \nnot only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn\'t hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written . \nand the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i\'ve ever seen . \nnaturally , the true star here is sandler . \ni think the guy is flat-out hilarious . \nhe can say something that just isn\'t funny , and his delivery makes me laugh . \nhis comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy . \nwhereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into . \nas far as i\'m concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents . \nand the movie is just so funny . \nperhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him . \nthis is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air . \nand while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half . \nmy formal complaints for the wedding singer aren\'t very important . \nthe film is predicable , but who cares ? \nthe characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable . \nin addition to this , i can\'t imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film . \nin that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review . \ni just want everyone to know that i laughed . \na lot . \n',pos
'on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento\'s much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . \nin emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his \" giallo \" murder mysteries . \nwhile it\'s certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . \nthe story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book \" tenebrae \" . \nwith the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . \nthe film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . \nhe brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . \nthe film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . \nargento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . \ntenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento\'s scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . \nit may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . \nin that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . \nneedless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director\'s brilliance as a stylist . \nmany of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . \nthey are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . \ninstead , tenebrae\'s set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . \nand the soundtrack\'s mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . \nso tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . \nstill , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . \nsome critics argue that logic doesn\'t matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don\'t deserve to feel cheated . \nby the way , if you don\'t want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . \nabout an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . \nwe witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . \nhe is insane , apparently . \nthe murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it\'s time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . \nhe is finally revealed to us as this \" second killer \" in the film\'s bloody climax . \nbut argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . \nyou see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer\'s house . \nbut thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . \nbad cutting puts the timing way out . \nin other words , he\'s almost in two places at once . \nduring this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . \nby the film\'s end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . \nthe injury ? \nhe banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! \nthus , the revelation of the \" hero \" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . \nhelpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . \nbut there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . \nthe story owes us a better understanding of franciosa\'s mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . \ntenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . \nfor instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . \nwe would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren\'t even introduced too ! \nthat\'s careless filmmaking , pure and simple . \nwhy , you may ask , do i go on about the story\'s flaws ? \nbecause when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . \ntake one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . \nan upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . \nfinally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer\'s lair . \nit\'s an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . \nand that\'s exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . \ntoo often , it seems , argento\'s films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . \nmind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . \nand if you\'re a fan of argento\'s unique style of giallo thriller then it\'s essential . \nsee the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . \nit\'s a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . \na shame , because it doesn\'t have to be that way . \ntake argento\'s more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . \nproof that he can do it , if he tries . . . \n',pos
'plot : a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention . \nthe boys eventually get together to split the money , but as plans change , double-crosses occur , dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road . \nwho\'s on the up and up , who\'s the real bad guy and who\'s gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie . \ncritique : the funnest movie that i\'ve seen so far this year ! \nit\'s got style , it\'s got tough guys talkin\' shite and it\'s got plenty of bullets to go around . \na definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin\' adventure ! \na guy\'s guy movie through and through , and one that\'ll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff . \nit\'s not very original , it goes on for a little too long , but costner and russell make it happen , as two shite-kickin\' elvis lovers , who don\'t stop till they , more or less , drop . \nthis movie\'s got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes , one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i\'ve ever witnessed , featuring several elvises with guns a blazin\' and the king\'s music playing in the background , and a decent helping of double-crosses , sharp dialogue and funny moments . \nin fact , even though the cast is filled with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part ) , most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim . \nbut the true glue that holds this film together , other than the spirit of elvis himself , is costner and russell , who play their badass characters to the t . sure , russell\'s been down this road before , but costner surprised me with his nastiness . \ni guess he\'s pissed at all the box-office bombs that he\'s been in of late , but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here . \nin the end , the bottom line with this movie is having fun , kickin\' ass and making sure there\'s enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards . \nand smoke \'em if you got \'em , folks ! \nthere is also this one really great show-down scene between costner and a cop , that\'ll have you crackin\' up and lovin\' it all at the same time . \nthe violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that\'ll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next . \nit should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background , with plenty , and i mean plenty , of camera tricks , cuts and edits , but for this kind of flick , it actually works . \nthe film is not perfect though , it starts off with a pretty big bang , but then pulls a way of the gun on us , and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle , while characters intermingle and disperse . \ni was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots , and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well . \nand did i mention that courteney cox looked mega-hot in the movie ? \nno . . . okay , \nwell i just did ! \ni coulda done without her whole \" romance \" angle , but to be honest , it doesn\'t take up much of the film , which is generally covered in blood , explosions , guts and elvis nods . \ntry to see how many \" inside \" connections to the king you can guess . \nof course , it\'s no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind . \ni also like these types of \" guy \" movies a lot , and even though the film doesn\'t bring much originality to the table , it does offer a pretty coherent story , some nice twists and turns , humor and a big ol\' helping of whoop-ass coming straight from costner and russell\'s respective boots . \nprobably not a film for everyone , but definitely for those who enjoy the guns , the charismatic bad guys and a fun , if entirely disposable , adventure . \nnow see how many elvis songs i\'ve used to pun my way through this phony review below . \nthe elvis songs also recommend this movie ! \nso whether you\'re lonesome tonight or any other night , remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets , leave your little sister at home , bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse , cause this movie ain\'t one to return to the sender . \ni really beg of you , whether you\'re stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel , to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender . \nand no suspicious minds either , folks , cause i got stung by this movie , i mean it really shook me up , and unless you\'re the devil in disguise himself , i think you won\'t be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either . \nso don\'t be cruel , don\'t turn away , don\'t curl up with your latest flame tonite ( whether she be a hard-headed woman or not ) and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film . \nit\'s now or never , folks . \ntrust me , i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i\'d seen so far this year is far behind me . \njoblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building . \nthank you . . . thank \nyou very much ! ! \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ?

'i know that \" funnest \" isn\'t a word . \n \" fun \" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . \nbut that\'s the word that came to me right after viewing \" chicken run . \" \nno wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like \" that was the funnest movie i\'ve ever seen ! \" \nso to hell with webster\'s -- \" chicken run \" is one of the funnest movies i\'ve seen in a while . \ni can\'t remember the last time i\'ve seen anything funner . \nthe chickens at tweedy\'s farm are up to something . \nliving in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . \none night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . \nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm\'s egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . \nshe orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , \" chickens go in ; pies come out . \" \nwhat sort of pies ? \nchicken pies , of course . \nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park\'s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \nthing is , the film doesn\'t feel like it\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \nbut they\'re * chickens * , so it\'s funny to us . \nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park\'s films ) succeed is the animators\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\'re cribbing . \nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \nthere\'s even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\'s nationality and film history . \nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \nconsider this : since july of last year , i\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \nwhy ? \nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they\'re parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch\' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \nif you\'ve never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\'s understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \nenjoyment of this movie doesn\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\'ve got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \nthe characters\' inevitable romance doesn\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\'t any help . \njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \nthe animation is first-rate . \nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug\'s life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\'ll catch all the details . \nanyway , the movie\'s just a boatload of fun . \nfunnest damn movie i\'ve seen all year . \n',pos

'no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , \" jude the obscure , \" his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . \nbut , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . \n \" jude \" is a satirical film from start to finish about society\'s way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what\'s remarkable is how timeless this film is . \nthe film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn\'t really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it\'d be kinda different ( a given ) . \nit tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from \" shallow grave \" ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams . \nin its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world . \nafter marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life . \ntaking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself . \nbut when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker . \nanother reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher . \nshe and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) . \nseveral twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile . \nbecause they aren\'t married , and because they\'re cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on . \nif you didn\'t think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . . . \nthe sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world . \nhe will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life . \npart of it is his fault - he\'s too optimistic , and too gullible . \nbut society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death . \nthe ending of \" jude \" is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i\'ll have to read it now ) . \n \" jude \" offers a satirical view on society\'s cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn\'t . \nthere\'s no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem . \nsatire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people\'s minds , and that\'s what \" jude \" is . \nsure , it\'s one hell of a downer , but it needs to be . \nthe film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it . \nchristopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times . \nkate winslet , in a pre- \" titanic \" performance , is brilliant , nailing every psyche of her character , and creating someone who\'s troubled but very seductive with her personality . \nkate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don\'t believe me , see \" titanic , \" branagh\'s \" hamlet , \" \" sense and sensibility , \" and \" heavenly creatures , \" the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) . \nin the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude\'s wife , whom he never divorces . \n \" jude \" moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts . \nbut those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate \" jude , \" though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it . \n',pos
'it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters . \nhis new film , the thin red line , is a strange , beautiful , enigmatic mess of a movie . \nthe first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast . \nit is filled with above-the-title stars . \nthe cast , for the most part , gives great performances . \njohn travolta , whose role is nothing more than a cameo , seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve . \ngeorge clooney , whose role became a cameo in editing , gives a strange performance . \none wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character\'s narration . \nthe rest of the cast , especially nick nolte and elias koteas , are unambiguously fantastic . \nthese actors ( and they are , with two exceptions , men ) were lured by the name of malick . \nterrence malick is a cinematic legend . \nhe has often been called \" the j . d . salinger of cinema . \" \nhis two previous films , badlands and days of heaven , are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures . \nafter he made them , he disappeared for 20 years . \nthis film marks his return . \nwhat he\'s made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment . \nthe narration which fills the film ( and perplexes many ) not only lets us hear the narrators ( the characters themselves ) pontificate , but also lets us hear such of-the-moment thoughts as \" i\'m scared . \" \nthe rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted . \nthe plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill . \na plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult , because the story is fractured . \nmany stories are here , from the clash between the lieutenant ( elias koteas ) and the savage colonel ( a voracious nick nolte ) to the private ( ben chaplin ) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going . \nthe fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault . \nit is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box , shook the box , and poured the results onto a table . \nthis basically creates a mess , but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed . \ni\'m not declaring that the film has no structure . \nwhile saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot , malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat . \nthe battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking . \nthe astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice . \nthis film uses color and light in such a fantastic way , that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video . \nultimately , malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them . \nthe film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature . \nwhile some have said that the anti-war message and pro-nature tubthumping was juvenile , it was done with so much complexity and thought , that it cannot ever honestly be called childish . \nafter seeing the thin red line , i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again . \n',pos
'as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan\'s latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . \nbut also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . \nonce again , chan\'s screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star\'s character simply jackie , with no last name . \nthis jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . \nof course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter\'s ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . \nother plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . \nthe sole purpose of mr . nice guy\'s existence are chan\'s comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . \ndirector samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan\'s , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . \nother impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw . \nnone of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop\'s thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx\'s daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively . \nbut the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film\'s end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan\'s athletic prowess ) . \nfilmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan\'s latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980\'s the big brawl and 1985\'s the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker . \nhopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before . \n',pos

'the story of us , a rob reiner film , is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film , as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films . \nwell , 1999 has two of them , the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family , american beauty . \nthe story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry . \nthe story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , \" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ? \" \nthe film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are \" him \" and \" her \" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are \" us \" ( during the good times ) . \nthe story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day . \nben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don\'t want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don\'t , love each other anymore . \nben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage . \nkatie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn\'t mind doing things differently than they were planned . \nthe story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks . \nas the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage . \nthis method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart . \nthrough the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character\'s eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters . \nthe screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson\'s films , stepmom . \nthe script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must . \nif it wasn\'t for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year\'s best picture . \nbruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer\'s the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script . \nalthough i wouldn\'t pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film\'s most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season . \nwhere to start about michelle pfeiffer ? \npfeiffer\'s performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism . \npfeiffer\'s performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart\'s of any viewer that has watched this moving film . \nthe story of us is one of 1999\'s most real , yet funny films , as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked . \nsuperb acting , direction , writing , story , and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film , which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman , make the story of us a touching , unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country- and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall . \nthe film\'s major high points are the fights between ben and katie , as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed , and although they also say things like \" it\'s over , \" or \" i hate you , \" you can tell the two still share a deep connection , and that inside , somewhere , they are still an \" us . \" \nthe bottom line : a wonderful , enchanting , and heartbreaking film . \none of the most realistic , heartbreaking films in recent years . \n',pos

'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \non december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax\'s genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . \nalthough the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre . \nthe sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes . \nthe strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost . \nscream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line\'s a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight . \nand scream\'s rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion . \nit\'s hard to understate this last point . \nmr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) . \nindeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion\'s share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2\'s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional \" a film by wes craven \" drapes the film\'s title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads \" written by kevin williamson \" , an affirmation of the screenwriter\'s contribution to the project which may be unprecedented . \n ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of \" a film by \" is attained . ) \nand , much like mr . tarantino\'s screenwriting , mr . williamson\'s work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters . \nin scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels . \nscream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson\'s rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel . \nwhile the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it\'s only at about the film\'s midway point when it becomes engaging . \nlike its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film\'s principal narrative ; this time around , we\'re following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the \" true life \" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) . \nhowever , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i\'ve ever seen ) . \nthere are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn\'t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream\'s ; while the first film\'s preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical . \nflash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film . \nthe murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney . \nthey\'re joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded . \nthe film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn\'t necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? \nthere\'s a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney\'s new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o\'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy\'s fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale\'s newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens\' portia di rossi ) . \nany of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim . \nas is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit . \none problem that scream didn\'t have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer . \nhere ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson\'s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery . \nthe film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements . \n ( it doesn\'t help matters any that the killer\'s alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . ) \nindeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes . \nthis is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it . \nwhile the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it\'s head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences . \nthey\'re staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch . \nit\'s hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown . \nin terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) . \ntheir verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there\'s a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed . \non the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here . \nshe doesn\'t have any compelling presence , and there\'s nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she\'s the returning heroine . \ngiven this , and the fact that there\'s no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal\'s role isn\'t nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan\'s shoes ) , it\'s no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film . \nwhat surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast . \nthe film\'s mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you\'ve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel . \n ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would\'ve seemed obvious . ) \nbut hey , as rose mcgowan\'s character said in the first film : \" no , please don\'t kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! \" \nlook what that got her . \n',pos
'this christmas , little ralphie parker ( peter billingsley ) wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree . \nalthough cautioned by many that he will ? shoot his eye out\' , ralphie remains optimistic , conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers . \nit could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun , and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one . \n`a christmas story\' is a favorite among many during the holiday season , and boy , it is certainly easy to see why . \nralphie\'s endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood , when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable . \nevoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things `a christmas story\' does so well . \nhere are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season : \n1 ) period detail . \nthis film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard , who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940\'s with loving detail . \nshepard narrates from a first person point-of-view , divulging his various adventures one snowy december , in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head . \nshepard\'s first-hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious , but also witty and warm , with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing . \non top of that , young billingsley\'s stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration . \ndirector bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality . \ni can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like . \n2 ) mom and dad . \nboth melinda dillon ( as mom ) and darren mcgavin ( as ? the old man\' ) are perfect in their roles . \nit\'s hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one , with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured . \nfor instance , he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound , and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues . \nin portraying the writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad , peter billingsley has struck quite the chord . \nhis performance is richly textured , making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment . \nwhich brings us to . . . . \n3 ) the comic situations . \nthere are plenty of memorable moments in `a christmas story\' . \nmoments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing , with so much more to explore and to cherish . \ni am particularly partial of the ? f-word scene\' , in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four-letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard . \nagain , shepard\'s method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry . \nthe numerous sequences that stick in one\'s mind include , of course , the famous department store santa scene - in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree . \ni could go on , but i\'ll finish on this note : `a christmas story\' is a standout among holiday movies , because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes . \nnot only is it funny , it\'s often genuinely hilarious . . . . not to mention warm , fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places . \ni plan on making `a christmas story\' a christmas tradition . \nwhy don\'t you ? \n',pos
'virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre . \nsince \'dark city\' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another . \nthe most popular and original of them all has been the matrix . \nall the films released after it , have been less successful . \ndavid cronenberg\'s existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone . \nand when \'the thirteenth floor\' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored . \ni admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again . \nit was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to \'the thirteenth floor\' . \nhowever , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak\'s latest picture . \nmatrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood\'s action and effects with an intelligent story . \nexistenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness . \n\'the thirteenth floor\' is somewhere in between . \ninstead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , \'the thirteenth floor\' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding . \nin a near future . . . on \nthe thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real . \nright after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered . \ndouglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth . \na beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence . \nthe first \" download into simulation \" is impressive . \nit is the creator\'s first visit to his world , his creation . \nin order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone\'s identity , become another person . \nthis is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people \" wake up \" in unknown places and strange things start happen . \nthey start to doubt in their own sanity . \nthese innocent people pay for the mistakes of their \" users \" and creators with their sanity and their lives . \nit is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone\'s fantasy . \nwith an appealing ( \" blade runner \" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present . \nour modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal . \nthe thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile . \nthis contrast demonstrates a wish for change . \nvirtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities . \nto some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences . \nfor others - a way to start over and \" correct \" their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past . \nvirtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life . \nat least that\'s how it is all beginning . \nbut when you\'re waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise . \nthis , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness . \nsome important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ? \nwhat is thought ? \nwho are we ? \nif these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made . \nthey are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner . \nthe visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes . \nkirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties . \nthere are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose\'s moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time . \na rather unusual thing about\'the thirteenth floor\' is the almost complete lack of special effects . \nthere are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion . \nthis is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking . \nthis is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and \'dark city\'-fans will be pleased . \nthis film is interesting and inspiring . \nit has everything existenz doesn\'t , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix . \nand then there is a happy end which , like in \'dark city\' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context . \nthe plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and \'dark city\' . \nwith this in mind , \'the thirteenth floor\' doesn\'t make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality . \n',pos
'it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+ , the farrelly brothers+ latest film . \ni knew the film would be funny--the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see . \nbut i also knew the film would be an equal-opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon . \ni figured the film would be raunchy , maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell . \ni may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ? \ni needn+t have worried . \n+mary+ is the sweetest , warmest , all-out laugh-and-grossfest this side of _animal house_ . \nsurprisingly , the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side , and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers . \nthey make laughter , the toughest job for a filmmaker to do , look easy . \nthe plot is typical . \nthirteen years ago , geeky ted ( ben stiller ) lucked out in having dazzling mary ( cameron diaz ) go with him to the senior prom . \nas luck would have it , on that very day , he was hospitalized . \nwhy , i shall not tell , but i assure you , it isn+t pretty . \nhe hires a private investigator to find her : pat healy ( matt dillon ) . \nhe becomes one of the great comic villains . \nupon finding her , he too is lovestruck , and so pursues her , lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped . \nit is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double-crossed , and goes to get her for himself . \nwould the geek get the girl ? \npuh-lease . \nthe ending is pure hollywood ; no surprises there . \nbut the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers , hair gel , the mentally disabled , the physically handicapped , interracial marriages , homosexuals , skin conditions , serial killers , tanning , and drugged-up dogs . \nthe dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission , and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame . \nand yet , for all the targets that are hit , the film maintains its sweet tone . \nmary , playing the straight role , is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful . \nshe is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother , warren ( w . \nearl brown--miles away from the cameraman in _scream_ ) . \nmary+s sunniness carries the film here--it compliments the below-belt gags that come at you . \ncameron diaz makes her totally charming , and the audience respects her , even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window . \nben stiller also fares very well , totally changing his image from his _reality bites_ and _flirting with disaster_ straight men to being a , ( how to say it ? ) , a complete loser . \nbraces , greasy long hair , not too bright , and very very funny . \ndillon is exceptionally creepy , especially with his capped teeth . \nand rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom ( chris elliot ) , tanning addict magda ( lin shaye ) , modern troubador/greek chorus ron lichman , and mary+s sweet mom , markie post ( where has she been ? ! ) . \nnot everything works . \nchris elliot+s role , skin blemishes and all , becomes merely tasteless and boring . \nthere+s lousy dialogue about eight-minute vs . seven minute exercise tapes . \nand there are long stretches without much going on . \nbut the wait is worth it . \nwhen those extraordinary sequences hit , the entire theater erupted with howls , tears . \nbelly-aches , that in some sequences carried over to the following scene . \nthe farrelly brothers have finally done it . \nyes , there are some raunchy bits , but when it is all over , it+s not nearly as bad as it could have been . \nwhile tasteless , it didn+t cross any lines , at least not with me . \nwhile raunchy , it wasn+t nearly as bad as _porky+s_ or _boogie nights_ . \nand it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick . \nafter the funny but sour _kingpin_ left a negative aftertaste in my palate , comes the funniest sex farce since _a fish called wanda_ . \napproach this with an open mind , and you will reap the benefits hugely . \n',pos

'a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! \ni didn\'t really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family . \nthe movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based . \nmy real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked , anyone ? ) \ni was surprised to discover a truly entertaining , often hilarious yet also touching little film . \nit is an al franken production through-and-through , who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture . \nfor those of you who don\'t know , al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley , who has a really annoying show on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem , etc . although not a licensed therapist , stuart smalley is , as the program proudly boasts , \" a graduate of several 12-step programs . \" \nstuart is doing well enough with his tv show , but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles . \nstuart\'s relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d\'onofrio , respectively ) are alcoholics , his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce , and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking . \nthen , disaster strikes . \nstuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked . \nhe is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself , and there the comedy truly picks up . \nfranken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes , but as sharply-drawn , real people . \nalthough smalley\'s dad has always imbibed too much , stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy . \nalso , after an accident towards the end of the movie , both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought . \nalthough filled with small , very funny scenes , stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments , especially towards the conclusion . \nfor a lightweight comedy , it handles these scenes especially well , often better than many so-called \" serious dramas \" of today . \nall the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one-joke bit . \nif you feel like renting a comedy , and you haven\'t seen this film , i definitely recommend you try this one out . \nyou\'ll laugh . . . you\'ll \ncry . . . . it\'s \nall there . \n',pos
'weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them . \nin the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out . \nit certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank . \nby now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants . \n`seahaven\' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras . \nfor 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we\'re given , \' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji\' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him . \nthus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program . \nin a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through . \nthis allows us to comprehend and accept truman\'s world before we contextualize it . \nfor all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it . \ntruman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed . \nthe surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment . \ncinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images . \nas well , it employs wojciech kilar\'s piece \" zycie za zycie\' masterfully and beautifully . \nif the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney\'s characterization as meryl , truman\'s \" wife \" ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman\'s `father\' , which feels curiously incomplete . \nthere are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman\'s audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film . \nthey wear buttons asking `how will it end ? \' \ni couldn\'t wait to know myself , though i didn\'t exactly want it to end , for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most complex-summer picture in years . \n',pos

'steven spielberg\'s \" amistad , \" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who \" owned \" them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story . \nfirst , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery . \nsecond , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . \nlast , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade . \n \" amistad \" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements . \ni have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another \" anti-slavery \" movie . \nhaving seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn\'t already know about it . \nfortunately , i turned out to be wrong . \nfor one thing , spielberg\'s camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders\' operations in africa , so \" amistad \" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning . \nand some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery . \none scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their \" excess \" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year . \nspielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating . \nthe stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time . \nexposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation . \nthe film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court . \nthe biggest success of \" amistad \" is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court . \nthrough cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ . \ncinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles . \n \" what kind of country is this , where laws \'almost\' work ? \" he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court . \nspielberg\'s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque\'s angry outburst in the court room . \nstill , there isn\'t enough of this for it to be a serious problem . \nthe main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can\'t quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie . \nthis summer\'s contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once . \n \" amistad \" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through . \nperhaps the best way to describe it is this : \" amistad \" is three four star films edited into one . \nalmost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts . \nhowever , i can\'t honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery . \n',pos
'when i first heard of contact , the hype was building it up as a sci-fi blockbuster . \nnow , with that in mind , coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster\'s involvement in the project , i thought \" what in the world is foster doing in a sci-fi blockbuster ? ? ? \" . \nas it turned out , my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy-turvy . \nrobert zemeckis , back from the euphoria created by his last film , forrest gump , once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit . \ndon\'t get me wrong , contact is sci-fi ? but with a definite difference . \nbased on the late carl sagan novel of the same name , the story delves itself in questions on science and god ; fact and faith . \nallie ( foster ) is a radio astronomer . \nshe spends her time listening to the stars , via ultra-huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system . \nher passion for `long-distance communication\' is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham-radio system ( a hobbyist radio communication device ) which her late-father bought for her . \na scene which particularly strengthens the audiences\' view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late-mother through the ham-radio system in which her father replied \" not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that , now \" . \nallie\'s research is based on the seti project ( search for extra terrestrial intelligence ) , in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation . \nher work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government , which considers it a waste of taxpayer\'s money and politically unviable , her supervisor ( tom skerritt ) pulls the plug on seti . \nundaunted , allie managed to gather a loyal group of `believers\' and eventually found funding from a large private corporation . \nthe following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day , she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound-wave . \nthe news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers , cultist , the media and of course , the government . \nthe situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission . \nas the world join forces to build this transport , allie is desperate to be the one to go . \nshe enrols herself among a few hopefuls , to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation . \nher eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president\'s spiritual advisor ( mcconaughey ) ; allie , being an atheist , a result of her belief in fact and science , refuses to budge upon questioning . \nat this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president\'s spiritual advisor . \na strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey . \nfrom the very first meeting scene , it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects , foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith , hope and the power of the unseen . \nthe meeting of their worlds , added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless . \nmany people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous , but by actually immersing yourself in it , gives you an entirely different perspective ; one which is free from bias and pre-conceptions . \nzemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film . \ncontact works by not delving in controversy but rather , touches the thinking audience , urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith ; whether one can actually find compromise within . \ni consider contact as one of the must-sees for this year . \n',pos
'you\'ve got to love disney . \nno matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it\'s animated . \nkids have to go see the movie . \nthen they have to get the toys . \noh , the video came out ? \ngot to buy it , or risk little billy\'s temper tantrums for the next month . \nall of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom . \nstay at the disneyland hotel ! \nbuy a disney t-shirt ! \neat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! \nit\'s both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it . \ndale carnegie should have had it so good . \nwhat\'s most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality . \nyou see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot . \nthe theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not . \nthe plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same . \nhowever , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer . \nluckily , disney\'s latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula . \nthe film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) . \nsoon , china\'s emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china\'s defense . \nwhen the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household . \nfearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army . \nmulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling . \nmulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman\'s role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that \" grace \" is not one of her strong points . \nvery early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one\'s family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task . \nby leaving home to fight in her father\'s place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too . \nas is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film . \ni\'m not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time . \nboth lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan\'s army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga\'s voice translates much better to animation . \nyou have to hear it to understand . \ninterestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan . \nthere is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie . \nit is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney\'s own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing . \nartistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically \" disneyfied \" ethnic tale . \nthere are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu\'s hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast . \nthe other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it . \nwhen mulan resolves to take her father\'s place , she dons her father\'s old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword . \nas she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal . \nit just left me thinking , \" that was really cool . \" \na wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang\'s conscripted army . \neven more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan . \nalthough an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance . \ni found the choice of b . d . \nwong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short\'s wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything\'s possible . \nin any event , wong performs admirably as well . \none character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa . \nshe deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people . \njune foray , who supplies grandmother fa\'s speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) . \nmarni nixon , who provides grandmother fa\'s singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady . \nwith this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history . \nmulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films . \nin an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a \" miss saigon \" -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles . \nin addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei . \ni guess clyde kusatsu wasn\'t available . \nat a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults . \nthis is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better . \n',pos

'ingredients : neophyte lawyer , legal situations , corrupt insurance company , \nsynopsis : rudy baylor ( matt damon ) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time . \nrudy\'s girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband ; rudy\'s elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded , and ; the family of rudy\'s friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldn\'t pay for a bone marrow transplant . \nrudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned , but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser ( danny devito ) who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge ( danny glover ) . \njon voight plays leo f . drummond , the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all-powerful insurance company\'s team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice . \nwill rudy defeat leo ? \nwill he enjoy being a lawyer ? \nopinion : the good news is that this movie has a happy ending , and it features a guy trying to do the right thing . \ndirector francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie . \nin the typical lawyer movie there\'s one big case and the movie focuses on solving it , and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins ( after lots of gripping courtroom drama ) . \nhowever , coppola\'s movie is deliberately more low key . \n\'the rainmaker\' plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters . \nin the background rudy\'s voice narrates his feelings and makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general . \ntwo factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be . \nfirst , rudy\'s time is split juggling three cases , rather than concentrating on a single high-stakes case . \nalso , rudy\'s use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge . \nthe end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win , and rudy narrates his way into coming of age . \n',pos
'when you go to the movies as much as i do , you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times . \nsuch was the case with frequency . \nevery time i went to a screening , there was the frequency preview . \nit looked awful . \nit looked cheesy , sappy and ridiculous . \nit looked like a flop . \nwell , whoever put that trailer together should be fired , because in terms of pure entertainment , frequency is one of the best of the year thus far . \nfrequency boasts a compelling story line . \nan occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan ( james caviezel ) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) through a ham radio , despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years . \njohn is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire , but by doing so causes other changes . \nsomehow , a serial killer\'s reign of terror , which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders , extends to ten victims . . . \nincluding john\'s mother . \nthis is director gregory hoblit\'s third film ( the other two being primal fear and fallen ) . \nwith all three , he\'s managed to attach himself to great scripts ( this one by toby emmerich , whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films ) and add equally great direction . \nalso , he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick-ass ending . \nfrequency is no exception , the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying . \nhoblit is three for three , and i hope he can keep it up . \nnow everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci-fi elements of frequency . \nbut the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved . \nwho\'s to say how something works and how it doesn\'t when it\'s never happened ? \nis it because we\'ve become accustomed to time travel \" laws \" from other places like \" star trek \" and the back to the future trilogy and \" quantum leap \" ? \nyes , if you sit down and think about it , certain plot elements in this film probably won\'t make any sense . \nmost films are like that . \ndon\'t let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however . \nwhen frequency was over , it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug ( okay okay , shut up ) . \nwhen you break it down past all its sci-fi elements and serial killer antics , frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share . \nit\'s touching , it\'s sincere , and it\'s what ultimately makes this movie work . \n[pg-13] \n',pos

'the \" submarine \" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is . \nthink about it . . . \nthese films are completely based in reality , yet only a handful of people have ever been on one , making them fascinating to the general public . \nthey aren\'t like movies that take place on a plane or a train , as anybody can get on one of those . \nand they aren\'t like movies that happen in outer space either , because no one\'s done any of that stuff yet . \nwhen a new one comes out , you don\'t hear anyone say \" ugh , another submarine movie \" like people tend to say \" ugh , another boxing movie \" . \nlook at modern movies that involve submarines : das boot , the abyss , the hunt for red october , crimson tide . . . \nall are well regarded as top-notch entertainment . \ngladly joining that bunch is u-571 , which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u . s . naval submarine during world war ii . \nwe learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior ( bill paxton ) . \nmcconaughey\'s crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma , a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence . \nthe mission goes horribly wrong however , and as a result , mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew ( as well as a captured german ) become trapped aboard the u-571 in enemy waters . \nthe first great thing about u-571 is the film\'s opening sequence . \nthe german crew of u-571 are under attack , which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion . \nit\'s tense , exciting and fascinating . \nand i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles . \nmost movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away . \nonce the plot gets moving , u-571 gives us action sequence after action sequence , making the audience wonder \" ok , now how do they get out of this ? \" . \nthe stakes keep raising ( much like in executive decision , an excellent action-thriller ) , and even though the audience knows how the film will end , it\'s a lot of fun getting there . \ni only have two minor complaints about the entire film . \nthe first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence . \nwhile their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going ( which they do ) , i feel as though it could have been done much quicker , and less conventionally . \ni mean , did we really have to see the ship\'s crew at a wedding ? \nbecause of that , you now know exactly what\'s going to happen to the groom ! \nmy other gripe would be during the film\'s finale . \nthere\'s an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president\'s plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one . \ni cannot stress this enough . . . \nuntil a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect , stick with using models . \nyes , u-571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you \" that couldn\'t happen \" , but the overall point of this film is entertainment . \nit succeeds fantastically . \n[pg-13] \n',pos
'we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist . \nyears later we see his subsequent resurfacing ; in the mid 80\'s a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world . \nthe movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown . \nbased on the life story of david helfgott , this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child-genius , compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father . \nin the 1950\'s helfgott emerged as a child prodigy . \nthe film traces his relationship with his father , whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys . \ndavid is offered places in the usa , but his father refuses to let him leave australia . \nthe effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot ; david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher\'s house . \nhe is well lit via the external house lights . \nhis teacher isn\'t home . \nwe pull back and see that the dark front room\'s window has it\'s curtains open . \nthere , in a pool of blackness , is a grand piano . \ndavid\'s fall over the dark cliff has begun . \ninstead of being told in a linear mode , shine jumps around in time , ala \" pulp fiction \" . \nthis narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy , teenager in london and mental-patient in various snippets . \nthe film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion . \nadult-helfgott\'s return to the light is told in linear fashion . \nthe lead role is played by 3 different actors , with the teenage-david ( taylor ) and adult-david ( rush ) standing out . \nwhilst rush is known for his tv work in australia , i think this is his first major cinema work . \nhis david , whilst clearly damaged - he keeps quoting his \" daddy \" in a babbling word torrent , cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts - is both touching and funny . \ntaylor\'s teenage-david is the more sympathy producing role . \nwe are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building . \nhis father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov\'s 3rd , whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart . \ntechnically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production . \ni particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects . \none scene has adult-helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain . \nthe sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice . \nwith a clever subtlety , the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping , but of the same beat . \nthe image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd . \nbut it\'s us being clapped . \nwe are young-david walking up to the stage for our first public show . \nthe music , as you would expect from a film of this subject matter , is critical . \nand it works very well . \nthe \'miming\' of the actors piano playing is faultless ( apparently rush didn\'t mime ; he really did play ) \nhelfgott\'s life is certainly not without it\'s sympathetic people . \nindeed his return to the \'normal\' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women . \nhis ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft . \nit shows that with the \'help of god\' we can all find our way back home . \n',pos
'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nduring the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low . \noh , he\'s been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film . \nit\'s been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino\'s new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s . \nthings aren\'t going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) . \nshe\'s 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( \" $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren\'t worth a damn \" ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she\'s just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) . \nthe loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he\'s soon out to silence jackie brown . \nmeanwhile , the authorities\' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars . \nonly through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses . \nalthough jackie brown marks mr . tarantino\'s first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel \" rum punch \" ) , there\'s no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film . \nwhile he\'s adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character\'s now black . \nin terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions . \nthe opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era . \nthe timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro . \nof course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it\'s perhaps the most tender scene of the year . \ntenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? \nsure , there\'ve been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr . tarantino\'s films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter . \nthese staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what\'s new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation . \nthis effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he\'s the real deal . \nthis new aspect of mr . tarantino\'s storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary , sensitive , and exceedingly-professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching . \nmr . forster\'s nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him . \nmuch press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta\'s then-sagging career . \nas it turns out , ms . grier is solid in the film\'s title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range . \ni do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she\'s been working steadily over the years , often in direct-to-video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton\'s mars attacks ! \nand larry cohen\'s original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . ) \nof course , it\'s true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry . \nwhile jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better . \nand while the film\'s narrative doesn\'t really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it\'s filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn\'t an unengaging moment . \nwith an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it\'ll be interesting to see what he tries next . \n',pos
'the happy bastard\'s 30-second review \nbig daddy \nhappy gilmore as a father ? \nof course ! \nthat\'s the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy , a movie that\'s passable but isn\'t really considered some of sandler\'s best work . \nhe doesn\'t actually play happy gilmore in the movie , but a variation of him . \nhe\'s sonny coufax , a man who\'s living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one-day-a-week gig as a tollbooth man ( tollbooth willie ? ) . \nhis girlfriend ( kristy swanson ) is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him . \nenter a 5-year old kid , who\'s mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate ( jon stewart ) , who\'s off in china on a business trip . \nfrom there , coufax basically acts as the kid\'s father , teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks . \nhe even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker ( joey lauren adams ) , but , somehow , he also garners the attention of social services , who aren\'t particularly pleased with coufax\'s actions , as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid . \nthe reason i say it\'s not really sandler\'s best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow didn\'t really belong in a sandler vehicle . \ni mean , it fits the movie\'s tone and everything , and sandler handles it well , but it\'s just oddly placed , that\'s all . \nfortunately , it doesn\'t destroy the goofy glee path it\'s been following and it still makes you feel good . \nsandler does a good job here , as he does in most of his movies . \nrob schneider , however , is irritating as his friend , an immigrant delivery boy who can\'t read . \nstewart , in his minor time on screen , is great , and adams remains a joy to watch . \nlook for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum . \nhe\'s a hoot . \ndirected by dennis dugan ( director of happy gilmore ) , the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with . \nagain , there are faults , but , hey , everyone needs to get emotional sometimes . \n',pos

' \" the tailor of panama \" is a different kind of spy movie . \ndespite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . \ninstead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . \nbased on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story . \nbrosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice . \nhis british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement . \nosnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base . \nwhen shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning . \nbrosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end . \nsearching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite . \nharry claims to be a transplant from britain\'s renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle\'s shop in an insurance scam . \nhe also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm . \nosnard offers harry a way out . \nhe will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele . \neager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . \nbefore long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director . \nharry\'s little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own . \nosnard turns in reports about the \" silent opposition , \" a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal . \nthe bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway . \nmeanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker . \nand harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies . \ngeoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor . \nrush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity . \nafter gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems . \nalthough she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her . \nof the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence . \ncurtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles . \nspeaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here . \nharold pinter is amusing as harry\'s uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways . \nalso shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism . \nbut the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists . \ntheir presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . \ndirector john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . \ninstead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there . \nthe metropolis , described by one character as \" casablanca without heroes \" pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people . \n \" the tailor of panama \" succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment . \n',pos

'it\'s ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director\'s cut of the film . \nfilms such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker\'s integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio . \nthe advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films . \nthe dvd release of the original international version of luc besson\'s 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director\'s cut . \nfor years , i have heard of an \" international \" version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years . \ni even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors\' cuts - including l ? on . \nbut after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it . \nuntil now . \nthe film follows the story of l ? on , played by jean reno , a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello . \nhe lives next door to a ferociously independent 12-year-old girl named mathilda - played by then newcomer natalie portman , whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops . \none day , a crew of the cops - lead by gary oldman in an over-the-top performance - kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries . \ntaking pity on her , l ? on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life . \nmathilda learns of l ? on\'s hit man profession and decides to follow in l ? on\'s footsteps as a \" cleaner . \" \nshe then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l ? on he has kept locked away as part of his profession . \nat this point , the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in . \nthe international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l ? on and mathilda , footage that american censors deemed \" too explicit . \" \ni assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle . \nthe best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda\'s and l ? on\'s motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops . \nthere\'s even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean-hugues anglade - star of queen margot , besson\'s la femme nikita , and killing zoe . \nwith these additional scenes replaced , l ? on and matilda\'s relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version . \nthe most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes , the film becomes primarily a heavy , emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film . \nthe film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema . \nmy advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional , throw down twenty bucks , and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece . \ndirector/writer : luc besson producer : luc besson , claude besson starring : jean reno , natalie portman , gary oldman , danny aiello \n',pos
'the happy bastard\'s quick movie review \nanalyze this \nhow does one do a comedy focused on the mob ? \nwell , a few years ago , there was a sly little comedy called the freshman , which had marlon brando doing a romp of a send-up of his famous don corleone character and , recently , the utterly stupid ( in a bad way ) movie mafia ! \nfailed to really get the joke . \nthis time around , however , warner bros . may have gotten it right with analyze this , a movie that hits its targets more than it misses . . . and \nfor plenty of reasons . \nthe story goes like this . \na mobster ( robert deniro ) finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late , fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a near-death following a drive-by shooting . \nit\'s these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist ( billy crystal ) who\'s mostly reluctant to take the mobster\'s case for two reasons . \nfirst , of course , he\'s a mobster , but secondly , he\'s trying to get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife ( lisa kudrow ) and kid . \nand , of course , he can\'t rest worth for a moment because the mobster\'s goons are always needing the shrink for something , be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation . \nfortunately , the movie is played out for plenty of laughs . \ndirector harold ramis ( who also helmed the comedy multiplicity , which wasn\'t half bad ) keeps the tone peppy and light , even if it\'s sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments ( shootings can\'t always be taken for laughs , you know ) . \ndeniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy , giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas , but with a bit of a lighter heart . \n ( a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious . ) \ncrystal plays an excellent straight man to deniro\'s character , uplifting him from such bombs as father\'s day and my giant . \nkudrow is also a hoot as crystal\'s wife-to-be , who\'s on the verge of a breakdown thanks to deniro\'s presence . \nis the movie perfect ? \nnot really , thanks to a simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri ( he\'s a comic actor , too , come on , give him some more ! ) , but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for a change , taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy . \nkudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show , either . \nline of the movie : crystal : \" when you said you needed family therapy , this is not the family i had in mind ! \" \n',pos
'this is a film about secrets , some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl , frances boyd ( ashley ) . \nothers that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship , like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple , geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) , the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field , and his artist wife , lillian ( miriam healy-louie ) , who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work . \nand , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line . \nreceiving a summer grant to study \" chemo-electric therapy , \" geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three-year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her . \nhe has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses . \nhis main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don\'t want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science . \nthat he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming . \nhe is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty- years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins . \nthe third view in all this is the artist\'s , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist\'s work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , \" why shouldn\'t the same be true of the scientist ? \" \nshe argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored . \ngeoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company\'s higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can\'t wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life . \nwhile out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area . \nin the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . \nthe scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david\'s view but coming at it from a much different angle . \nit was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . \nthat the director\'s point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . \nthe point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . \ngeoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty . \nalex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex\'s apartment . \ngeoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him . \nthe relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely . \nthe dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies . \nthe only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david\'s loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city . \nthe farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist\'s lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way . \nwhat is progress ? \nwhat can one expect out of life ? \nis the small farmer about to become extinct ? \nthe answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . \nthat this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . \nno telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . \nthere is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don\'t like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . \nthat is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . \nthe stakes in this ecological struggle are that high . \nperhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . \nit was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso\'s guernica had for him . \nboth artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on . \nthe pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , \" make the world go away \" blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances\' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science . \nperhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ?

'the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane . \nbilly , played by michael keaton , is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble . \nchristopher lloyd portrays henry , an obsessive-compulsive who requires that everything be neat , orderly , on schedule , and by the books . \nhe thinks he\'s a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports . \njack , played by peter boyle , thinks he\'s jesus . \nand finally , there\'s stephen furst as albert , a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases . \nthe dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four-some when their psychiatrist , dr . weitzman , takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium . \nduring a pit stop , they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan . \nthe movie\'s charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast . \nthe four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively ; they never miss an opportunity to argue , bicker , or insult one another . \nhenry and jack , for example , fight over who\'s going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game . \nthe actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other . \nmichael keaton is well cast as billy ; he gives his cynical character considerable complexity . \nas the divinely jack , peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one-dimensional character funny and fresh . \nalthough stephen furst\'s catatonic character is cliched , the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing . \nwhile keaton , boyle , and furst are good , it\'s christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special . \nlloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance . \nhis body language ( for example , the way he walks ) and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character . \nlloyd\'s brilliant performance yields a pathetic , moving , and memorable character . \nthe dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise . \nthe characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot . \n',pos
'people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies . \noften science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller . \nin such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked . \nbut , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic . \nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman . \nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits . \nbut the right stuff film isn\'t even fiction . \nit was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program . \nthe plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes . \nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier . \nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado . \nbut one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records . \nten years later , soviets have launched \" sputnik \" marking the beginning of the space age . \nin order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space . \nbest air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image . \nin one of critics\' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s . \nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman\'s film looks quite atypical for its time . \nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life . \nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker . \nphilip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies . \nthe right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking \" artsy \" projects . \nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film . \nthe plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . \nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . \nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . \nsam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . \non the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . \nshepard\'s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn . \nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . \nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard . \nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots\' wives . \nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch . \ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman\'s superb direction . \nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . \nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . \neverything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . \nin that setting , it\'s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . \nbut the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and \" natural \" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . \ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity . \nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , \" mercury \" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . \nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman\'s superb use of poetic movie language . \nediting is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) . \nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . \nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space . \nanother fine contribution of this film is \" oscar \" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it . \nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy . \nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period . \nthis film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws . \nsome of the \" mercury \" astronauts aren\'t fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) . \nfilm also lacks proper closure . \non the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long . \nalso , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan\'s america . \nin some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s . \ntime has passed ; now we don\'t see astronauts as heroes . \nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . \nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . \nbut this film , sentimental reminder of the times \" when future began \" , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow \" mercury \" astronauts\' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . \nand even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema . \n',pos
' \" the celebration \" is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant . \nyou know , where you sit down to watch it , and no matter what you\'ve heard about it before , you just can\'t help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs . \ni prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like . \ni don\'t really feel there are to be any real \" rules \" for cinema ; a film can do anything , as long as it makes it work . \nbut i do ask that all films have one thing in common : they create experiences . \nwhen i watch a film , no matter what kind of film it is , i want to be able to take certain memories along with me . \n \" the celebration \" is great because it\'s chock full of those . \nit creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life . \nand then it makes things just a tad bit farscial , just to make sure you\'re paying attention , which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored , then you\'re of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up . \nthe story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him . \nall his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) . \nthe eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father\'s home . \nhis brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable . \nwe then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she\'s going to . \nonce they\'re all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film\'s punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age . \nbut since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it\'s all terribly interesting to watch . \ntwists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends . \nthe most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion . \nas a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose \" the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability \" so that they may \" purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot . \" \ni have not seen \" breaking the waves , \" the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but \" the celebration \" works exquisitely in this department . \nit feels like reality , like you\'re actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video . \nas a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to . \nwe see key moments in people\'s lives that they wouldn\'t dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film . \nthe key , though , to this film , and the reason it\'s not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth . \nthroughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water . \nof course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn\'t have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them . \nand yes , it\'s thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier . \nbut then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he\'s done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface . \nthe final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex . \neveryone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them . \nthe actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest : there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays , exactly like life . \nas such , \" the celebration \" may be the one truly bizarro film of the year : a work of art so eerily close to reality that it\'s utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating . \n',pos

'do film critics have morals ? \nare there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? \nnaturally we don\'t want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish . \nsecondly , and along the same line , we can\'t prejudge a film because of it\'s stars , director , etc . the difference ? \nwell , in the first one , we\'d go into a film thinking it\'s going to be dumb or it\'s going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i\'m not expecting much ) . \non the second hand , we\'re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal \" grudge \" against the film company ( it\'s made by disney ? \noh , it\'s just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey\'s in it ? \nit\'s gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? \ncan\'t be that good ) . \nthis is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint . \nmake sense ? \nok , but what about comparing ? \nisn\'t that kind of along the same lines ? \nwhen we compare a certain actor or director or even composer\'s credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? \nsure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? \nis it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? \ni think it is , and i\'ll tell you why . \na good critic should be able to view the film from the \" average joe ( or jane ) \" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film . \nsometimes that can be tough . \n \" the acting was superb , but i was bored \" or \" i loved it ! ! \nit was sooooo cheezy ! \" \nmight be used to describe a film . \nthese are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique . \nbut which is more important ? \nand which is better ? \nan extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? \ngetting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we\'re reflecting what the public wants to know anyway . \nevery average person out there who\'s interested in this film is likely to ask \" how does it compare to pulp fiction ? \" \nand so , as a critic , i\'m already responsible to ask that same question . \njackie brown stars pam grier , the \" blaxploitation \" heroine from the 1970\'s , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character . \ntarantino\'s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta\'s sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier . \n ( we\'ve made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction\'s samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) . \nordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars . \ntrouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed . \nnaturally this proves an obstacle to ordell\'s plans and , not as friendly intended as we\'d hope , he posts jackie\'s bail after she is put behind bars . \nthe thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he\'s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way . \njackie finds herself in a tight squeeze . \nordell won\'t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she\'s always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . \nit comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? \nwhat ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself . \ncoming into play is another 70\'s veteran , robert forster as jackie\'s bail bondsmen max cherry . \nmax\'s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . \nalso involved is ordell\'s \" surfer girl \" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand . \nfonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there\'s nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . \nde niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . \nde niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn\'t need a de niro to play him . \ncompared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . \nin pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn\'t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . \ntarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . \nsadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life . \njackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn\'t as awesome as the first time . \njules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . \nand although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don\'t think he\'s quite as irreplaceable . \nin fact , maybe a new face would have been better . \njackson could\'ve remained tarantino\'s jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . \nsadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn\'t as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . \nanother problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . \nthis is grier\'s film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? \nit not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story . \nit is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino\'s quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard\'s novel \" rum punch \" . \nfor those movie-goers , don\'t expect another pulp fiction and you\'ll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90\'s film- making . \nthe directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we\'re still reminded that this is tarantino\'s movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints . \nso getting back to the question that i began with , this isn\'t pulp fiction at all . \nit\'s good , but it isn\'t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place . \nthis is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won\'t satiate true fans . \nif you can realize that this isn\'t going to knock your socks off , then you\'ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet . \nafter all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy . \n',pos
'more than forty years ago , the \" sword and sandals \" genre of historical epic ruled the box office . \nduring the 1950\'s hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope . \n \" ben-hur . \" \n \" cleopatra . \" \n \" the robe . \" \n \" sparticus . \" \n \" the fall of the roman empire . \" \n \" quo vadis . \" \nsometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood . \nsince then , epics have appeared infrequently ( \" the last emperor , \" \" braveheart \" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970\'s ( \" roots , \" \" shogun \" ) . \nyet , the phrase \" we who are about to die salute you \" has been absent until now . \n \" gladiator \" begins in germania in a . d . 180 . \nroman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting . \nhowever , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again . \nwhen commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered . \nmaximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son . \na caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa . \n ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus\' place is never explained . ) \nan african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus\' wounds . \nproximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena . \nof course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads . \nwhen commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete . \nour hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus\' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) . \nthe similarities to \" braveheart \" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess . \nalso , like mel gibson\'s epic , \" gladiator \" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero\'s anger . \nit\'s a simple tale of good versus evil . \nmaximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family . \ncommodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience . \nthe opening night crowd in my theater was about 70\% male , and that seems appropriate . \n \" gladiator \" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a \" chick flick \" be a \" dick flick \" ? ) . \nthere\'s much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences . \n ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . ) \nlucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife . \njoaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance . \nin the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father\'s love or pride . \nthroughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who\'s scripted as a caricature of evil . \ni\'ve been a russell crowe fan since \" romper stomper . \" \nthis role doesn\'t offer him the complexities of his parts in \" l . \na . confidential \" and \" the insider \" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre . \nthe late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role . \ni hope it will be rewarded with an oscar . \nmy only major quibble with \" gladiator \" is its stylized look . \nseveral scenes are tinted . \nwe\'ve seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in \" payback \" and \" the matrix . \" \ni don\'t get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads . \nin \" payback \" it was merely annoying , but in \" gladiator \" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d\'etre of the roman epic . \n ( perhaps it\'s meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . ) \nalso , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously . \n ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . ) \nwith a more realistic look , \" gladiator \" could be even more satisfying than \" braveheart \" because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion . \nbottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices . \n',pos
'martin scorsese\'s kundun , which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama , has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure . \npersonally , i don\'t think it needs one : it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china . \nscorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do , as a larger-than-life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership : the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences , but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal . \nthe set design and cinematography are outstanding , and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle , it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao . \npolitical art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans , kundun does not : it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative . \n',pos
' \" if there\'s a beast in men , it meets its match in women , too . \" \nstarring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus \nin recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy . \nin modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals . \nbut in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge . \ncrows tear out the eyes of cinderella\'s sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version . \nhansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven . \nwriters have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots . \nbefore this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years . \nin the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan . \nthe story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose \'real\' life we learn very little . \nwithin the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen\'s grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways . \nthe result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale . \ni say \" surprisingly \" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong . \nand there are ways in which it does . \nthe performances are mediocre , except for lansbury\'s--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales . \nthe soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes . \nprobably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable . \nbut jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness . \none of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the \'realism\' of the screen . \npart of me would love to see an adaptation of \'the lord of the rings , \' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker\'s recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind . \nthis makes jordan\'s accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery . \nthe somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur-reality . \nthe sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant . \nthe nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly . \nthe peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary . \nthis archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you\'d expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter . \nfor carter , the cauldron of story is a witches\' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes . \nshe adeptly blends them all together . \nthere is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance . \nthe point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl\'s rites-of-passage on an unconscious , primordial level . \na night-journey through the forest , from the village to the grandmother\'s home , is the crux of the company of wolves . \n \" don\'t stray from the path , \" rosaleen is told , again and again , and the path is both literal and figurative : the path through the forest and the path of life . \nstaying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen\'s elders . \ncarter and jordan , never conventional , explore what goes on when you leave the path . \nthose who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate . \nthis fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves , but the werewolves connote many things : death , sex , knowledge . \nif straying from the path leads to death , then it\'s not a good idea--but if that\'s what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge ( and therefore power ) , then maybe it\'s worth the risk . \nwhen you leave the path , the world becomes a dangerous , ambiguous place , but it\'s full of potential . \nand it\'s certainly more interesting than the disney version . \n',pos

'i didn\'t realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa ( the motion picture association of america - the folks who decide what\'s g , nc 17 , pg , r or x ) to ask why the preview was rated r . so that we can make some sense of their response , let me tell you about the movie itself . \n \" the celluloid closet \" is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades . \nit\'s brilliant , funny , naughty and extremely poignant . \nit tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that , as a rule , gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen . \nregardless of how veiled - or how sordid - the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they\'re not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be . \nthe movie itself is rated r - and for good reason . \nit contains scenes of bloody , violent gay bashing and graphic , uninhibited , sex . \nas with any movie , i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time , so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend , a date , my 11 year old niece , alone or not at all . \nbut , that\'s the movie . \nnow back to the preview . \nprior to this film being theatrically released ( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo ) i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times . \nthere was no nudity , no violence , no bad language , nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience ( okay , whoopi goldberg did refer to someone \" boning \" someone , but the last i knew that wasn\'t one of the seven words you can\'t say on tv ) . \nexcept for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing . \nhmmmmm . \nwhen i inquired about the rating on the trailer , a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from \" the handbook \" that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain \" no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone . \" \nhello ? i was in the office and it was the middle of the day . \nbravely , i pursued . \n \" i\'ve seen that trailer , oh . . . \nprobably half a dozen times , \" i gulped . . . \n \" and i don\'t remember that scene . \" \n \" well , \" she chirped . \n \" it\'s there . \nour little eyes are trained to see that . \" \nno really . \nin the words of dave barry , \" i am not making this up . \" \nthey are \" trained \" to \" see that ? \" \nwhen someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made a note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her ? \ngosh , i certainly don\'t mean to question the mpaa , or \" the handbook \" . \ni would , however , like to suggest that it\'s they who are in the closet on this one . \nand the light ain\'t good in there . \nbut , having seen \" the celluloid closet , \" and being one of a handful of straight people involved in a primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study ( email me and i\'ll give you the details ) , none of this was any big surprise . \nthe point of the movie was that homosexuality , even in the politically correct 90s , is ridiculously perceived as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society . \na point well made in this candid and honest film . \nnow , i could go off on the mpaa\'s ruling that a trailer must contain \" no homosexuality or lesbianism \" and ask how that is defined , particularly in light of some of the things , both sexual and non-sexual , that i\'ve watched straight people do in trailers . \ni just don\'t feel the need to go there , because it seems so obvious . \ni\'ll instead suggest that the mpaa re-evaluated their evaluation criteria . \nlet the ratings reflect not subject content , like \" sex \" and \" violence \" . \nlet them reflect attitude content . \nin the future , i\'d be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated d for disrespectful or s for stereotyped . \nthen i\'d truly be able to make an informed decision about how i spent my time . \n',pos
'i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years . \nit was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood . \nbut of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex . \nyes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster . \nfor all teenagers , it\'s almost like a rite of passage . \nand what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking . \nand all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer . \n`american pie\' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year . \njust how great are their hormones raging ? \none of them notes , after watching disney\'s the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot . \nthe four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim . \nkevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend , but doesn\'t want to have sex until the time is just right . \nbut what is the perfect time ? \nthere is just no way to know , and that frightens him . \noz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive . \nhe joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages . \nfinch is the phobic hermit who doesn\'t stand a chance with any girl . \nso , he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess . \nsuddenly , girls are lining up to go out with him . \nbut among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful . \nwhen he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student , his inexperience comes shining through . \nhe has much to learn , and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge . \nthis may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom\'s apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny . \nthe one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r\' rating . \nthere is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there\'s something about mary\' was gloriously ribald . \nin fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen-accessible rating . \nbut i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison . \nteens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest . \nbut unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here . \nthese are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex . \ntheir plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences . \nthey know what they want , yet temper it with responsibility . \nbut almost always , it\'s impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster , and it\'s these episodes that make `american pie\' such a carnal delight to watch . \n',pos

'well i\'ll be damned , what a most excellent surprise . \nnot to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex-porn star traci lords , this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950\'s drive-in schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best sci-fi flick of 1995 . \nonce again , b-movie king roger corman is behind this effort ( he directed the original ) but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer . \nthe rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns . \nit seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries , because it\'s an absolute must-see for sci-fi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent . \nthe plot in brief . \npaul johnson ( michael york ) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who , though needing to kill people to live , is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons . \nhis race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure , the key of which lies in the blood of humans . \nhe visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr . rochelle , whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf . \nhe also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda ( elizabeth barondes ) to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires . \nbut before long , amanda and johnson\'s sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric . \ni must admit , my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging . \nbritish actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades , a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat ( 1972 ) . \nbut his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding . \nthe weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech , the dapper clothes and cool spectacles , the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character . \nyork is by turns hilarious , menacing and tragic . \nthis is a tour-de-force and quite simply the best performance i\'ve seen from him . \nand while obviously made on a modest budget , the film boasts enormous strengths . \nthe casting is spot on , the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent , witty and consistently engaging , cleverly updating the original . \nthe balance of horror and humour is just about perfect , a marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988 . \nthe film doesn\'t drag for a second of its 90 minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of little-known director terrance h . winkless . \nand it doesn\'t matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy - this is schlock after all , even if it is high class schlock . \nin fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end . \ntighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their life-threatening situation . \nbut these are minor complaints . \njust see it . \nnot of this earth is one of the biggest sci-fi surprises in years . \nand michael york : in one cool swoop you\'ve made yourself a b-movie legend , dude . \n',pos

yes and no . \nmainly yes , i\'m happy to say . \nthe first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i\'ll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron\'s directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the \" human \" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting . \nthe film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a\' course ! \n : - ) ) . \nwell , it\'s an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat . \ndoes it work here ? \nin script form it doesn\'t add all that much to the story . \nwhat does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film . \nher presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her . \nalso impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving . \nit\'s an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack\'s \" rescuing \" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching . \nin fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance . \nit\'s engaging , touching and very enjoyable . \nthere\'s more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it\'s not going to be a happy ending . \nwhich leads us to the second half of the film . \nwe all knew it was coming . \ni\'m sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he\'s stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film . \ni think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die . \nthe iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour . \nand it is an hour . \nmy goodness , we don\'t miss a second of that hour ? \ngratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today\'s standards , i\'m sure there\'s been far worse produced under the banner of \" entertainment \" in other films . \nbut i certainly wasn\'t prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be . \nnot that i\'d expect the word \" understatement \" to be part of cameron\'s vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as \" terminator 2 \" and \" aliens \" ) . \nis it overdone ? \ni thought so . \nunderstatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy . \nno , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn\'t quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film\'s second half . \nstill , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears ! \nyou really couldn\'t help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose\'s overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive . \nperhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface . \nthe bit where rose lets go of jack\'s hand , while promising she\'ll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it . \ni loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half . \nso , we\'ve established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive . \nhaven\'t mentioned the script . \nplot-wise it\'s ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i\'ve a feeling that\'s to the actors credit if anything . \nas for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 . \nit\'s a period drama . \nbut i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned . \ndid they really use phrases like \" goddamn it ! \" \nback in the turn of the century ? \ni doubt it . \nwould someone talk like this : \" do ya love the guy or what ? \" . \ni doubt it . \nis such dialogue as \" i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now \" not just a bit ? clumsy ? \nyes it is . \na little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) . \nstick with directing , dude . \nbut its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast . \nstar of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn\'t she win that oscar ? ! \nafter all , they were throwing oscars at \" titanic \" left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee . \ndirecting-wise cameron does a spectacular job . \nlike i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well . \ni haven\'t even mentioned james horner\'s beautiful score . \nutterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it ! \n ; - ) \ni\'ve finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would ! \njust leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ? \nhell , don\'t talk to me about oscars . \nbloomin\' farce . \nit was deserving in a number of departments , though . \nlast question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ? \nnope , i don\'t think so . \nit\'s certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i\'ve ever seen , but i don\'t think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites . \nand as for the fact they\'re reportedly making a \" titanic 2 \" ? well i guess that\'s typical hollywood for you ! \n',pos
'in , \" the muse \" albert brooks plays steven phillips , a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio . \nthey claim that he\'s lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them . \nhe knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over . \nso he turns to his \" best \" friend , jack ( jeff bridges ) another screenwriter who\'s enjoyed success after success . \non the way over to jack\'s house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman ( sharon stone ) into a cab and begins to think : is he having an affair ? \nwhen confronted , jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is , in fact , a muse , a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity , and has helped him garner his success . \n \" she doesn\'t do any actual writing , \" he is told , \" but inspires you . \" \nsteven is excited by what he\'s hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if she\'ll take steven on as a new client . \njack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present , preferably something from tiffany\'s . \nafter the meeting the muse , sarah decides to take on steven , but at a price : she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her ( like bringing her salads in the middle of the night . ) \nsteven\'s wife ( andy macdowell ) sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon . \nsteven confesses everything and , although at first suspicious , she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life . \nthe only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he\'s going through for her . \nand that\'s a question only time will tell . \n \" the muse \" is albert brooks\' sixth film as writer/director/actor ( he co-wrote with monica johnson ) and although it\'s a good movie it\'s not up to the level of his best works ( \" defending your life \" and \" mother \" ) . \nthe problem lies in the script , and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor , there aren\'t nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good one-liners . \nit has a great premise but doesn\'t deliver up to it\'s full potential . \nbut , i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit . \nhe may whine and complain , but he just wants to support his family and be happy . \nand i like sharon stone in this movie too ; it\'s a nice change of pace for her . \nand i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner , james cameron and martin scorsese . \nand although \" the muse \" doesn\'t have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman\'s \" the player \" i still left the theater feeling good . \nand that\'s something i wish i got out of more movies . \n',pos

' \" psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred \" . \na blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip-off . \nbut no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento\'s most consistently successful film . \nwhat impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento\'s directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative . \nscreenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions . \nno question : argento has always been a better director than a writer . \nfortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called \" suspiria de profundis \" . \nthe film\'s storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches . \njessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance . \narriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state . \nwhat happens next - and i don\'t make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock\'s infamous shower scene in psycho . \nit\'s quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento\'s own . \nthough nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria\'s opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school . \nwe meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well . \nseveral more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn\'t want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film\'s climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that\'s most impressive . \nthe english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about . \nfortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film . \nthe dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region . \nand the soundtrack ? \nit is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else . \nas it stands , the use of goblin\'s music in suspiria is outstanding . \napparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts . \na stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer\'s overall experience . \neven better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you\'ll get the added bonus of widescreen . \nand the colours ! \ndeep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast . \nthe cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb . \na nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors . \nthese kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento\'s more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked . \nsuspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status . \nthe gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that\'s always been one of argento\'s shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror . \n',pos
'jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation . \neven though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation . \nthis is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction . \nto say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk \'til dawn . \nhe was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide . \n ( i\'m willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him . ) \ntarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director\'s helm . \nnearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own . \nthe film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her . \njackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas . \nthis makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico . \nhowever , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u . s . for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs . \njackie didn\'t know they were in the package with the cash , but that\'s of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted . \nof course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell . \nordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police . \nsure enough , ordell shows up at jackie\'s apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she \" borrows \" max\'s pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell . \ninstead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol\'s chamber to ordell\'s head , jackie proposes a deal . \nsince ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell\'s half million dollars . \nwith a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ? \nby itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film . \nhowever , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think . \njackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she\'s also making a deal with the feds as well as with max . \nthe film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around . \ninstead , it\'s actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today\'s movies . \nat least this film has a little imagination . \nmost of the performances in jackie brown are above par . \npam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable . \nsamuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control . \nrobert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . . \nnever mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy\'s apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course . \nhe\'s just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn\'t occur to us , even when we\'re shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade . \nin supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell\'s , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town . \nunfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences . \nin this film , he\'s not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , \" little bit , \" and \" pretty much . \" \nfonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side . \nas is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy . \nit grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves . \ndon\'t count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however . \nthere\'s a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he\'s not really sure what\'s happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what\'s going on is felt simultaneously by the audience . \nwe look at the screen and think , \" gee , that\'s clever , \" and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on . \nalthough tarantino isn\'t afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film . \nthere are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head . \nthis is a tribute to both direction and acting . \nhowever , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something . \nwe get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she\'s looking for , but instead hoping she\'ll just stop . \noverall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well . \nsome flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it\'s really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today . \nin fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these \" offensive \" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness . \ngo see the film and see what i mean . \n',pos

'ladies and gentlemen , 1997\'s independence day is here ! \nit\'s title : starship troopers . \nand surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 . \ni realize that i gave last year\'s sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . \nafter subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn\'t as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review . \nstarship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem . \nas a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film . \nin fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film . \nstarship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether . \nwhile starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : \" the \'star wars\' of the 90s . \" \nam i being to generous to this film ? \nperhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races . \nin essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction . \nthe easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . \nstarship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a \" kick-the-aliens\'-asses \" style . \nid4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . \nthis new \" star wars \" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . \nthe alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects . \nhowever , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . \nsometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . \nmore than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . \nand they should be . \ni doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film . \nthis is an \" event \" film , but surprisingly above average . \nit is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . \nstarship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange \" join the army \" ads . \nmixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . \nstating , \" would you like to know more ? \" , \nthese short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously . \nhowever , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . \nafter witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . \nwe are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . \nrico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . \nhowever , carmen isn\'t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot . \nhowever , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . \nunfortunately , rico isn\'t interested in dizzy . \nthis setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch . \ncarmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up . \nand as a result , dizzy signs up . \neveryone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry . \nthe main story follows rico through his trials and relationships . \nin reality , i found myself watching a space version of \" melrose place , \" but with better special effects . \nan hour into the film , the war begins . \na sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with . \nthe first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . \nfollowing the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . \nthe bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . \nmany dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs\' attacks . \na sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . \nthe troopers are ordered to locate the \" brain \" and capture it . \ni hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot . \nit\'s about special effects and gory violence . \ndirector verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . \nverhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . \nstarship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year\'s event horizon . \nthe r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . \nmy guess is that verhoeven\'s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . \nthe film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . \ndespite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . \nwhile watching the film , we never second guess the character\'s decisions because they seem perfectly clear . \nthankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . \nthe cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . \ncasper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . \nto most guys , he will come across as artificial . \nfortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . \ndina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character . \nher dizzy is extremely likeable . \ndenise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . \njake busey , gary busey\'s son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . \nneil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . \nhowever , he does give a good performance . \nmichael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . \nhis performance rises above the rest . \nperhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside\'s presence on screen . \nunfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . \ndirector verhoeven is the main star of the film . \nhis direction is fast and unrelentless . \nhe never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . \nwriter edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . \nthe writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . \nthe dialogue is smart but not too smart . \nwe aren\'t required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . \nthankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don\'t ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . \namazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . \nin fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . \nthe moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . \ni haven\'t laughed this loud , even in some comedies . \noh , and the special effects are first rate . \nstarship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . \nbelieve me when i say this : don\'t take young kids to see this film . \nit is extremely violent . \nin fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . \nhowever , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . \nit\'s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . \nand still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world . \nnow that would be entertaining ! \n',pos
'seen at the 21st portland international film festival \nfilm title : supermarket woman director : juzo itami country : japan 1997 cinematography : yonezo maeda music : toshiyuki honda cast : nobuko miyamoto , masahitko tsugawa , shiro ito , yuji miyake , akiko matsumoto super features : typical itami film . . . \nfunny and pointed in its own way . \nif you don\'t care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket , then this film is not for you . . . . \nmaybe it is better to ignore it , as this strong and biting satire , as only juzo itami can deliver , will give you an insight as to what some foods go through . \nhaving , in the past , made films that pulled every punch imaginable , from the family traditions ( the funeral ) , to taxes ( a taxing woman & a taxing woman returns ) , to the diabolical gangsters ( minbo ) , to hospitals ( the seriously ill ) , juzo itami , this time takes on the supermarkets\' own war , to get the consumers . \nand while this film has its funny side , in the crazy situations that it creates , it also shows another side , which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer . \ngoro has a supermarket . \nand a competitor comes into the neighborhood , trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket . \nbargains galore , its name , has in mind the closure of goro\'s humbler venue , so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can . \ngoro hires hanako , a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management , than they are in anything else . \nhanako , as she gets familiar with the operation , discovers many of the tricks of the trade , done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market . \nand the procedures , are not always \" fresh \" food , but a new packaging and a new date , to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves . \nhanako\'s ideas take hold , starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket , being that they do not even shop there at all . \nand hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference . \nif not cause some serious problems in the running of the store . \na price error , forces them to give away eggs for very low prices , and causes the store a few hassles , but , it brought the people in , and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things . \nas the operation gets stronger , the competition also has trickery up its sleeve , and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers , as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors . \neventually these people are found out , and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully , until in the end they all have a showdown . \nand here , the truth and honesty win out , and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent . \nin the process , they also find that \" freshness \" ( with some very funny jokes on this word as well ) becomes a much more important tool than they imagined . \nwith some very nice performances , in this hectic , and fast paced film , this film gives us a sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways , although a failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much , even though towards the end it is suggested . \nbut this would take away from the satire and its strengths . \nwith food gags all over the place , the film lets you have it . \nand what fun it is . \nworth seeing . \n ( editorial ) the director of this film , juzo itami , died shortly after the film was finished , and he left behind a legacy of comedy and satire that is rare , and uncompromising . \nwe would wish that he had been able to make one about film making , of which he must have had a few stories to tell , but we will have to do with much of the japanese society , and its many errant ways . . . . \nnot to say that these things do not happen anywhere else . . . . \namerica is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all , should anyone have the guts to tackle it . . . \nwe could learn something along the way , too . . . . \nworth seeing , specially , is a taxing woman and its follow up a taxing woman returns . \nthe funeral is also good , although not as funny as the later films . \ntampopo is also very enjoyable . \nall four of these films are available in video , which means your best local site for foreign film may have them . . . \nask for it . \n',pos
'there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor\'s effort . \noften a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . \nwhen one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders . \nbut sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with \" the hurricane . \" \nthis biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin \" hurricane \" carter would normally be called \" norman jewison\'s \'the hurricane , \' \" as per the tradition of referring to a film \" belonging \" to a director . \nbut though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of \" the hurricane , \" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington . \nwashington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar . \njailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals . \nthe situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter . \nthrough the efforts of that group and carter\'s lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted . \nthe film details carter\'s childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) . \nwhen he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide . \ndespite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned . \nflash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison . \nthe book , entitled \" the sixteenth round , \" opens young lesra\'s eyes to the injustice that was carter\'s life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer . \nlesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal . \n \" the hurricane \" leans on denzel washington . \nhe must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly . \nit\'s probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be . \nit would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film . \nthe actor\'s work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm\'s length . \nwe feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost . \nwashington\'s is a performance of weight and emotional depth . \nhe doesn\'t merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level . \nhis work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor . \nnorman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection . \n \" the hurricane \" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely . \njewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing . \nhis boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from \" raging bull , \" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage . \njewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell . \njewison\'s best achievement in \" the hurricane \" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again . \nsadly , though , the film\'s chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter . \nthere is much to interest a viewer in \" the hurricane , \" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does . \ntake a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil . \ncarter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype . \nthe canadians are good . \nthe cops are bad . \nthe canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film\'s failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya\'s ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room . \nmuch of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( \" hate put me in prison . \nlove\'s gonna bust me out . \" ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special . \nit\'s too bad . \nthe cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often . \ni wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than \" he\'s a racist pig . \" \ni wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice . \nin short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens . \ncriticism has been levied against the liberties \" the hurricane \" takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved . \nfor example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner . \nmost accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly . \nfurthermore , much of carter\'s criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained . \nof course , \" the hurricane \" works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don\'t remove one fact : \" the hurricane \" is a highly flawed film . \nonly one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it\'s a good thing \" the hurricane \" has that actor . \ncarter has been quoted as saying , \" denzel washington is making me look good , \" but he\'s not the only one . \nwashington makes this film look good . \ndenzel washington\'s \" the hurricane . \" \nsounds pretty good to me . \n',pos
' \" seven \" is one of the best mystery movies i\'ve ever seen . \nit\'s extremely intriguing and suspenseful , but it\'s also quite fun . \nit\'s a serial killer mystery , but you don\'t care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer . \nthe story is a cops-on-the-trail-of-serial-killer mystery . \nsomeone is murdering people who are offenders of \" the seven deadly sins . \" \na fat man ( gluttony ) was forced to eat himself to death , a lawyer ( greed ) is slaughtered by his own rich possessions . . . \ni could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much . \nwhat makes this film so unique is the characterization of the \" good guys \" which makes the unseen villain seem so vile . \nbrad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills , the cocky rookie . \nhowever , morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset , the wise veteran on the verge of retirement ( and he doesn\'t get killed by the end ) . \nthere is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief . \nthis is impressive because the mood is so tense , and the fact that it can be down-played as well as it is here ( let alone at all ) is quite an accomplishment . \nthe setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil , scary place many believe it to be . \nthe production design is superb , in the spirit of \" batman \" and \" the crow , \" this film embodies the gothic mood . \nthe way the words fade in and out , along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level - even the credits are scary ! \nthe killer\'s victims have no connections at all , and thus mills and sommerset don\'t have much to go on to solve the case . \nthey can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense . \nwe become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown . \nnot that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this . \nthe only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect . \nlet\'s just say it seems a little too \" mystery movie , \" or too convenient in other words . \nwhen they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe , a terrific chase scene ensues . \nthis is a typical thrilling element , but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story . \nif anything , this film is the epitome of twist endings . \ni don\'t have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal , but the way in which this happens is surprising . \nthere is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives , and even though he\'s obviously insane , his charisma makes for some good points . \nwhat\'s even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the film\'s resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is . \n \" seven \" is not just a film about crime , but about the evil within man . \njohn doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of \" scum . \" \nbut as justified as he makes himself seem , we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice . \n',pos

'\'lake placid\' is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie , ok so maybe it is , but this one is enjoyable , and clever . \nactually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film . \nwell the ending is kinda scary , but in most horror/comedies they are . \ni will admit that \'lake placid\' isn\'t an oscar worthy film , but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny . \nbridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating , is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth , after a man is bit in half . \nshe gets there but really doesn\'t understand why she is there . \nbill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened , along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man , they go out and find what is going on . \nwhat they find though isn\'t great . \na huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid , over 150 years old , he has migrated here for who knows why . \nthey have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from . \nbetty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid , and well you\'ll have to see the movie to find out . \nher character is very funny and foul-mouthed , which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad , but funny . \nto me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws . \nwith the opening sequence , and some others , it is not original and is . \nwhen you watch this movie , you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it . \ndavid e . kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal , writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job . \nthe characters have smartmouths , two foul , and some great one-liners . \nbut believe me , don\'t take \'lake placid\' too seriously or you won\'t like it . \nbut it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun \'popcorn\' type movie . \nbut i guess it rates above the \'popcorn\' rating . \nsit back , watch the movie , laugh , scream , and whatever you want . \neven though the movie is r , and i put violence and gore . \nthere\'s really not that much gore , but what there is might seem kinda gross to some . \n\'lake placid\' is a smart , clever , funny , and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too . \n',pos

'the ring is probably one of the creepiest movies i\'ve seen in years . \nbut then again , i\'ve always had this phobia of asian born horror films . \ni remember when i was a kid i was scared as hell with those green faced , long-haired floating ghosts donning their white gownseuuugh . \nthe ring really brings back those memories and its grips me long after the movie has ended . \nunlike the horror films coming from the west , i\'m pretty much used to the gore and visual effects , so much so , they become rather bland nowadays . \nthere\'s really no scary movie from the west for a long time . \nif you have something in mind , please tell me . \nthis japanese flick is supposed to be based upon stories written by `the stephen king of japan\' , which is also ( i heard ) televised over the air in japan . \nthe film revolves around a mysterious videotape which will bring death for sure to the person who watches it , one week prior to viewing . \na journalist and her husband , stupid enough , tests the so call `urban legend\' and ends up having a week before she meets her doom . \nshe and her husband then goes on a search for the origin of the videocassette , to get to the root of the whole curse with the hopes of freeing themselves . \nthe ring plays on the senses like no other horror film today . \nvisual subtlety , minimal music and an intriguing plot puts the audience within an aura of suspense throughout the entire film . \nvery well done indeed , especially for a film that does not have a single trace of violence and gore . \nnow , thats something budding horror film-maker wannabes should consider looking into . \njust an idea of how visually powerful the film is , it is in japanese and subtitled in chinese ; both of which , i can\'t understand at all ( ok , i had a friend who gave me a gist prior to watching , but he revealed very little ! ) . \nthe twists in the plot , leading to an unforgettable climax ( will definitely leave an impression on the audience ) will have you at the edge of your seat . \n',pos
'vampire films , as well as other horror films , are usually dumb and predictable b-movies , meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks . \nit is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning , but has also a plot worth making movies about . \nbased on anne rice\'s novel , \" interview with a vampire \" is a long , dark trip to hell . \nthe film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present-day san francisco . \nthe camera slowly find particular window . \na shape of a young man is visible in the darkness . \n \" so you want me to tell you the story of my life ? \" . \nthe mysterious man is louis ( brad pitt ) , a two-century old vampire , telling his story to a fascinated interviewer ( christian slater ) . \nhis tale opens in 1791 louisiana , just south of new orleans , where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat ( tom cruise ) . \ngiven a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead , louis chooses the latter , a decision he will forever regret . \neverlasting life and eternal youth , promised to him by lestat , turn instead into never ending suffering , damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace . \nlouis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat , but , to sate his hunger , he must feed , and the blood of animals is not enough . \neventually , he pierces the neck of a grief-stricken young girl named claudia ( kirsten dunst ) , whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis . \nfor a while , they are one \" big , happy family . \" \nbut all things end , and claudia\'s growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation . \nwhen luis and claudia break loose from lestat , they travel to paris , where the euro-vamps santiago ( stephen rea ) and armand ( antonio banderas ) , who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned . \ndirector neil jordan ( \" the crying game \" ) together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere . \nas the film begins , there is an incredible palette of colors , beautiful sunrises , lush golden fields , green forests , inky-blue clouds and blending sun . \nwhen luis is \" born to darkness \" , everything suddenly changes to dark velvet , lit only by the silver moonlight . \nthe beautiful production design by dante ferretti , wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton re-create the multiple historical periods in the film . \nfrom the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the 18th century , to our present days . \nthe casting is likewise good , involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood , ireland and spain . \nthe controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective . \ncruise is energetic , sinister , charismatic , wild and bloodthirsty . \ncruise\'s lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance . \nwith alarming swiftness , the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror , as his murderous purpose becomes clear . \n \" . . . kill them mercifully , but do it . \nyou are what you are . . for \ndo not doubt , you are a killer ! \" \nthat is how lestat is teaching luis . \nbut behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages . \nbrad pitt is equally convincing as the \" vampire with a human soul \" . \nantonio banderas and stephen rea are effective , but since they play more or less secondary characters , their performances are almost invisible . \nthe greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst , who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character . \nthe world is changing around the little child , but she does not . \nshe remains unchangeable - a child for all eternity . \nonly her wise , dark eyes reveal her age . \nironically the film\'s only miss is the script . \nanne rice\'s novel is a very interesting read , and her script is rich , colorful and emotional , but it is also tiering and too melancholic , at times resembling a soap opera : \nclaudia : \" . . . . is that what i should do ? \nlet you go . . my \nfather , my luis , who made me . . . who will look after me , my dark angel , when you are gone ? \" \nluis : \" everything will be alright . . \" \nclaudia : \" do you really believe that ? \" \nand then they hug emotionally . \nmoments like those displayed above and luis\' self-pity is a bit tiresome . \nhowever rice\'s script is otherwise strong and well structured , bringing up humor and comic episodes , that were more or less hidden in the book . \nwhen lestat finds claudia\'s dead dressmaker , whom she has killed , he cries out : \" who will make you that dress now ? \nbe a little practical . . . . never \nin the house ! \" \nmoments like that are both entertaining and appealing . \nneil jordan\'s direction is beautiful and sensual as he plays with interesting issues like eternity , homosexuality , love and loneliness . \nhis gothic saga is not meant to scare , but to display these issues differently . \nwrapped up in mystery , his new , original picture brings vampire-films to a new height . \n',pos
'when casting the key part of the voice of moses , most people\'s first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer ( the saint and the island of dr . \nmoreau ) , but he was dreamworks\'s choice in their first traditionally animated movie , the prince of egypt . \nthe selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one , but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn\'t in the casting department . \nthe radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic , a la cecil b . demille , to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones . \nin the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children . \nanimated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies , now that is something fresh . \nlet me admit up-front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off . \ndreamworks\'s antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group . \nthe prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz , but it is much more satisfying . \nlike antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixar\'s a bug\'s life , the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices . \ndanny glover is the voice of jethro , jeff goldblum of aaron , steve martin of hotep , helen mirren of the queen , michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah , martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti . \nyou can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god . \nthe movie , which is weakest in the story department , is a cliff\'s notes version of demille\'s the ten commandments . \nthe script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses\'s life . \ndemille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice . \nat less than half of that , the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesn\'t establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters . \nwe meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket . \nwe watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses ( ralph fiennes ) , the future pharaoh . \nmoses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew . \n ( \" all i\'ve ever known to be true is a lie , \" moses complains . ) \nafter finding out his real identity , he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him . \nafter leaving egypt , moses comes back to ask ramses to let moses\'s people go . \nthis leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea , which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand-drawn animation of the most of the production . \nit is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling . \ndrawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses , blues and golds , the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last . \nthe construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust , and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun . \nthe most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has . \ndone with an explicit two-dimensional look , the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story . \neven though it has its weaknesses , the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre -- serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family . \nthis awe-inspiring movie deserves to be seen . \nthe prince of egypt runs about 1 : 30 . \nit is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family . \nhow old a kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child , but those over 8 will probably like it . \n',pos

what a cast . \nok here is the plot in this movie : linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic . \none day at her house metatron ( the voice of god ) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels ( matt damon and ben affleck ) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church . \nok now get this , she is told to find two prophets : one who talks a lot and one who doesn\'t , however she gets jay and silent bob instead ( who give us great performances ) . \nnow on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky ( chris rock ) and helps guide her to find these angels . \nsalma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way . \nazrael ( jason lee ) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win . \nbethany ( linda fiorentino ) has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith . \nwhat a movie , it is everything rolled into one : an offensive , offbeat , smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end , and ends up being a feel-good movie . \nwho would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself . \nnow for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart . \nyes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot , but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven , it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god . \nthis review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie . \nkevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie . \nof course the best ( and funniest ) of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob . \nprobably the best characters in movies that i like . \nthe star-studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin , jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while . \nthe script was written by kevin smith with many f\'words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn\'t and makes us laugh at the same time as we think . \nchris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well , with some classic lines . \nlinda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is . \nof course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay ( as well as silent bob ) . \nalan rickman , jason lee , salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles . \nbeing oscar winners for the classic \'good will hunting\' they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could . \nben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story . \nthe movie\'s only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it . \nhowever the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , \'dogma\' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to \'clerks\' . \nwhile being funny at times , in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can\'t deny it . \n\'dogma\' will offend people , especially deeply religious people , but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you . \nall kevin smith fans must see !

'every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre : with dramas , it was citizen kane , with arthouse it was pulp fiction , and with comedy it was , well , that jim carrey guy ( okay , so he\'s not a movie , but he did have a huge influence on the genre . \nnot to mention an expensive one . ) \nsometimes a movie even combines them all into a big , sprawling motion picture event , as did forrest gump four years ago . \nwith action films , it was aliens , whic was released to much hype seven years after it\'s equally-innovative parent , alien ( 1979 ) . \ndirected and written by james cameron ( t2 : judgement day , the abyss , true lies ) , the authority on action films , it was a masterful encore to his sci-fi thriller the terminator ( 1984 ) . \nwhile the original alien film was a dark , enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew , james cameron took the big-budget action film with aliens , which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing , although on a much-larger scale . \nand boy , did he take that route ! \ni\'d say at about 165 mph or so . . . \nthe film opens 57 years after the original , with lt . ripley ( weaver ) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel . \nif you\'ll recall , at the end of alien ripley , the only surviving member , cryogenically \" hibernated \" herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship . \nunfortunately , she thought she\'d only be out for a couple of weeks . . . \nonce she\'s returned to earth , ripley is quickly interrogated by \" the company \" , who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy . \nin truth , they believe her , as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an \" alien advisor \" . \nit seems that the colony planet was a once-breeding ground for the nasty aliens , and now all communication with the planet has been lost . . . \nit doesn\'t exactly take a genius to guess what happens next : ripley agrees , and before you can say \" big mistake \" , she and the half dozen marines , plus the slimy corporate guy ( reiser ) , who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve , are off to the colony . \nwhen they arrive , they find the planet in ruins . \nonly one survivor is found , a little girl , newt , who confirms that , yes , the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system . \nand soon enough , the marines come under attack from the aliens . . . \nwhat happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci-fi movie : the action scenes . \ncameron directs them so skillfully , and so suspensefully , that you\'re literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around . \nwhich features , in my opinion , the best fight scene ever recorded on film , as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death . \nmany people will tell you that this film , while being a great action film , has no real drama and is all cliches . \nwell , they would be wrong , my friends . \nif this film had no \" drama \" , then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards ? \nthat\'s right , best actress . \nyou know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and f/x has got to be good . \nin short , aliens combines all the right elements ( great action and f/x , drama , a good plot , good dialogue , and great villains ) into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time . \nthen again , maybe not . \nmovies rise and fall from glory and , sad to say , aliens was wrestled from it\'s throne of best action movie by another cameron film , t2 : judgement day , in 1991 . \nso who will be the next king ? \nwell , let\'s wait until december 19th and see yet another james cameron film-the highest budgeted film of all time-titanic to make that decision . \ni can\'t wait . \n',pos

'one of kyle mclachlan\'s earlier cinematic features , this movie has had an obvious influence on such films as the terminator ( 8/10 ) , species ( 7/10 ) and the more recent , fallen with denzel washington . \nplot : a science-fiction picture set in modern times , this thriller follows the exploits of an \" entity \" from outer space , who likes to inhabit human bodies , use them up until they are completely worn out , and then switch over to the next available receptacle . \nfbi agent ( mclachlan ) and local top cop ( nouri ) are charged with the capture of this \" thing \" before it\'s too late . \ncritique : this fast-paced , urban equivalent of the thing ( 8/10 ) , checks in on all cylinders for ultra-violence ( god knows how many people died in this movie ) , action and an overall rock \'n roll attitude . \nthen again , how can you go wrong with an \" alien \" that likes the ferraris , guns , heavy metal music and sexy girls ? ! \ngranted , the plot isn\'t the most elaborate of tales ( alien bad , find alien , kill alien ) , but i can honestly say that i was never once bored during the viewing of this entire picture . \ni wouldn\'t recommend it to those who don\'t like car chases , murders , and bland acting , but for all the rest of you out there , those who enjoy putting away their brains every now and again , sitting back , slamming back some salsa\'d nachos , and relishing in the cheeze some call film . . . \nhave a blast ! ! \ntwo scenes to watch for are both within the first ten minutes of this gore-fest . \nthe opening sequence is one of the most rockin\' scenes to open any action movie , and the subsequent extra-terrestrial \" transformation \" is another eye-catcher . \neven the late 80\'s special effects were okay . \nfollowed by the hidden ii in 1994 . \nlittle known facts : this film was kyle maclachlan\'s first non-david lynch foray into the world of feature films . \nhis first two movie appearances were in lynch\'s wretched dune ( 4/10 ) and the sensational blue velvet ( 8 . 5/10 ) \n',pos
'of the major horror sub-genres , vampire movies are easily the most adaptable . \nthink about it . \nfrankenstein movies haven\'t changed all that much because they still need that mad-scientist-in-bavarian-castle setting . \nif you made a frankenstein movie today , you\'d have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j . fox , there aren\'t any actors that could play a virus convincingly . \nmovies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt . \nthere\'s not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris , unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something . \n ( and there\'s that michael j . fox thing again . ) \nbut you can have vampires do anything , and you can place them in any genre you want , just about . \nyou can have traditional vampire movies ( bram stoker\'s dracula ) or have the anne rice version ( interview with the vampire ) , or play it for laughs ( vampire in brooklyn ) . \nyou can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california ( the lost boys ) to squalid mexican dives ( from dusk till dawn ) to your local high school ( buffy , the vampire slayer ) . \nwere it not redundant , you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires . \nany day now , i expect we\'ll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record . \nor , you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie -- and when you do that , you get blade . \nwesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie -- the silent , expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path . \nin this case , the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead , bleeding corpses . \nsnipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u . s . marshals , but does a demonstrably better job here as a half-vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers . \nblade is a silent , brooding presence , laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse . \nhe is as cold as his silver-bladed sword , as single minded as his garlic-filled bullets . \nyet , he\'s not without quirks : blade drives a battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent . \nlike any good hong kong movie , blade is heavy on the chopsocky action . \nfor some reason , blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti-vampire weapons of garlic and silver . \n ( blade dismisses a man-portable arc lamp as being too heavy , although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires . ) \nunfortunately , the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film , relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers , which it most strongly resembles . \nthe replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i didn\'t review -- mostly because it made no impression on me , and i couldn\'t remember anything other than noise , violence , and the intensity of fat\'s performance . \nblade has a little more going for it , and has the vampire myth to draw from -- but other than that , it\'s the same kind of movie -- exciting , with well choreographed action scenes , but with no resonance . \nwith a stronger villain ( stephen dorff is ( pardon the pun ) curiously bloodless as the head vampire , leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role ) , a wittier script , and a strong supporting cast , blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment . \nas it is , blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying . \n',pos
'as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left . \nfirst , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : \" if you liked scream , you\'ll love wild things ! \" \n \" campbell gives a stunning performance ! \" \n \" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! \" \n ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) \nnow , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way ) . \nwild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa . \ni\'m not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see . \nhowever , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film\'s charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating . \nbeing mormon , i\'m bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film . \ntrouble is , i have already seen it . \nand i like it ! \nwild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture . \nthe style in which it is filmed is rich in color . \nthe actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film . \nsure , it\'s all too good to be true , but ain\'t it fun to watch ? \nwhen movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it . \nthere will be people who don\'t want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it . \nwild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into . \nit\'s almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone ) . \nof course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous . \nimmediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time . \nwe can turn off our brains , right ? \nwrong . \nwhile you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn\'t turn out that way . \nthe film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present . \nthere\'s sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students . \nhe\'s heading the class discussion . \nthere\'s also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam . \nteaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about \'sex . . . \n ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) \' . \n \" what is a sex crime ? \" \nray asks . \n \" not gettin\' any ! \" \none student responds . \nthis pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch . \nhowever , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body . \nand so , wild things sets into motion . \nquickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn\'t want anything to do with her advances . \nkelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him . \nshe even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep . \nsurprisingly , that\'s really all i can tell you about the plot . \nany more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists . \nand what\'s more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable . \ngoing along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film\'s surprises , and then adds even more to them . \nthere are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen . \nand even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it\'s rather pleasing . \ngoing back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief . \nthankfully , the convoluted plot doesn\'t give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off . \nas for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is . \nthis is pretty much just one trashy film . \nhowever , it is the kind of trashy that isn\'t hard to watch . \nit\'s good trash , in a sense . \none , the screenplay knows that it\'s not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story . \nthis varies everywhere from kelly\'s mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running . \nbill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs . \nand two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed . \nwild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn\'t ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries . \ninstead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don\'t worry . . . \nit\'s not as graphic as you might think ) . \nthe heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon\'s full-frontal nude scene . \nit\'s very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it . \nand , for as long as i can remember , i don\'t think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it\'s not completely , but judging from the audiences\' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) . \nalso , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon\'s characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) . \nwhat first made me want to see wild things was its cast . \nneve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released . \nhere , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead . \nthe closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) . \ncampbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent . \nyou can tell she will be around for a long time . \ndenise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range . \nhere , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers . \nhopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability . \nand then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies . \nshe gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half . \ntowards the end she does get a bigger part . \non the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist . \nkevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it . \nyou must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen . \nand judging from many of the women\'s reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) . \nand then there is bill murray . \nhis performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film . \nas a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi . \ndirector john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works . \nhis direction is smooth and stylish . \nthe visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air . \nhowever , he seems more at home when the actors aren\'t talking . \nhis fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards\' climbing out of the pool is a highlight . \nthe cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures . \nthen , there is the music . \nthis was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film . \nit\'s hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it . \nit\'s wonderfully composed and presented . \nand be sure to stick around during the closing credits ! \nmcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) . \nhe has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events . \nsome may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot , but it\'s an entertaining way to finish the film . \nplus , there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun . \nwild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality , nudity , language and violence . \nagain , the nudity is rather unnecessary , but let\'s face it--people want to see it . \nso why not give it to them ? \nneve campbell , admirably , has a no-nudity clause in her contract , and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go , neve ! ) . \nthe sex scenes are graphic , especially the first one we see , between the mother and one of her deck hands . \none almost wonders how they got away with the r rating . \nthe language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity . \nand i can\'t stress it enough : don\'t allow kids under 18 to see this film . \nthe target age for the movie is the 18-24 range , and that\'s who should see it . \nit\'s definitely not for those under 18 ! \ndid i mention that this film is rated r ? however , for those that do get a chance to watch it , you will probably more likely be pleased , and may even take friends to see it the next time . \n',pos
'the postman delivers but not first class \nthe postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman \n[warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post-apocalypse stories , hope in a desperate situation , grassroots uprisings and kevin costner . \neven worse , i thought that \" waterworld \" was watchable . \nread the following with those particular grains of salt . ] \nit\'s the year 2013 and things have fallen apart . \ndue to a world war in the late nineties , the resulting three-year winter and a devastating plague , life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms . \nalthough this is the future , it looks like a western . \nas the film opens , kevin costner ( his character\'s name is never revealed ) is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company . \ngiving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging , costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders . \nrunning into even worse luck , he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem ( will patton ) . \nthe rag-tag retro-futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the \" clan \" \nafter a brutal boot camp , he ( and you can see this coming a mile away ) escapes . \ntaking shelter in a wrecked postal truck , he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either . \nonce he reaches oregon , land of beautiful women , bright youngsters and rock and roll ; he pretends to be a representative from the \" restored congress of the united states of america \" . \nthis scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants . \nfood and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby ( olivia williams ) who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile . \nshortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman ( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film ) become a reluctant item . \nalthough the postman knows he\'s running a fraud , the concept of renewed communications sets the kids\' imagination afire ( especially ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , his second-in-command ) and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through . \nthe revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists\' tyranny . \nthe postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner . \nalthough the movie appeals to my sensibilities , there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted . \nit\'s derivitive of costner\'s own \" waterworld \" and clint eastwood westerns . \nthere\'s little here that we haven\'t seen dozens of times before . \nthe film is often down-right corny . \na scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright-eyed child is embarrassing in its slow-motion banality . \nthe film\'s final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor . \ndespite the film\'s excessive three hour length , several things are never explained . \nwhat was the war about ? \nhow did civilization change so rapidly ? \neveryone has horses : where did all they come from ? \nthe \" law of eights \" that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film , but where ? \nare we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn\'t made their way west to help or conquer ? \nthere is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn\'t appear to make sense . \nthe tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments , but beyond that there are some oddities . \nthe evil army is called \" holnists \" which sounds coincidentally like the new age \" holism \" , but why ? \nis it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 , just one year after many ancient prophesies ( including the ending of the mayan calendar ) predict a new world for mankind ? \nwhy is the general named \" bethlehem \" ? \nthere seems to be some reason for that , but what ? \nsometimes the movie feels like a joke . \nan army of postal workers armed with guns ? \nconsidering the headlines of recent years , it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys . \nit\'s even more difficult to accept those re-powering the federal government as the heroes . \ngiven the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government , it\'s asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film\'s nationalism . \neven with its numerous flaws , the movie all comes together , if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have . \nit\'s doubtful that \" the postman \" is going to find much of an audience , but a few of us are going to have a good time . \nbesides we\'re all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug . \n ( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the \" michael redman \" arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is , to the best of his knowledge , not him . \nperhaps this similarly-named person should have used kevin costner\'s postal service . ) \n',pos
'as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you\'ve got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet . \ni am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world\'s biggest paid commercial for america online . \nand i wonder : is that so bad ? \nwell , the commercial part is . \nas for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i\'ll be okay . \nto paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act . \nthey are both wonderful , but for all of hanks\' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he\'s suitably obnoxious . \ntom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he\'s going to get the girl : the only question is how ? \nmeg ryan , america\'s high school sweetheart , can act . \nshe\'s had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don\'t , get the movie-- fantastic ) . \nbut , i like her best when she\'s , well , perky . \nshe is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime . \nsome people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don\'t really know . \nall i know is that i just like them both . \nthey have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that\'s really hard to resist , and i\'m not going to even try . \nthey\'re just really , really cute , sweet , and charming . \nhanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle . \nhere , the setup is a little different . \nkathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children\'s bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her . \nshe is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) . \nshe is also having an affair , of sorts . \nyou see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 . \nthey have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is . \nny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) . \nfox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children\'s bookseller named \" shop around the corner \" , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly . \nevery morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight \" to the death ! ! \" . \nit\'s a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have . \nit also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no \" let\'s have sex tonight \" mantra , if you\'ll excuse my bluntness . \nthis is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love . \nhmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan \" hook up \" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness . \nyou know it\'s going to happen , the question is now ? \nthankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids . \nit\'s all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good . \nhanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is . \nhe is , i believe , america\'s greatest actor . \ndoes he show it here ? \nnah . \nbut he\'s still tom hanks , and she\'s still meg ryan . \nwhich is what this movie boils down to . \nit\'s pure confection . \nall the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it\'s all really sweet . \nthere are some immense flaws , like pacing . \nthe last third of the movie really doesn\'t work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it\'s slow . \nonce hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow . \ni even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour . \nthe other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated . \ne-mail ? \nwhen my kids are my age , i don\'t know what we\'ll be using . \nbut hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history . \nthey just work together , and it\'s nice to see . \nit gives you , well , a smile . \nthe script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake . \ni was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was . \ni\'ve always believed that movies are very powerful , very powerful indeed . \nyou see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate . \nmovies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i\'d rather not think about that . \ni always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night . \nand i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had . \nhanks was the driving force behind one of the year\'s best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world . \nhe\'s also half of the glue behind the year\'s best example of pure entertainment . \ntom hanks and meg ryan are magical , as is this movie . \nit\'s a sweet , lovely affair with a technology twist . \nit may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face . \n',pos
'the happy bastard\'s 30-second review \nnotting hill \na cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral , notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott , a very popular actress with a $15 million asking price for movies . \none day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple london resident ( played by hugh grant ) , and sparks somehow begin to fly . \nsure , there are points of turmoil , such as putting up with grant\'s slightly disgusting ( but very hilarious ) roommate spike , anna\'s pesky ex-boyfriend ( alec baldwin in a humorous cameo ) , and , on top of all that , those damn press . \nit\'s a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy , very different from , say , a stubborn father or \" not the right time \" like as seen in usual flicks . \nroberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress , and grant is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a hold of what has actually happened with this girl . \nin short , a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs , particularly provided by spike . \none tee-shirt really says it all about him . \nin an attempt to turn on a woman , he shows the front of the shirt , which says : \" you are the most beautiful woman in the world . \" \non the back ? \n \" fancy a f * * k ? \" \n',pos
'many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward . \nmost will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors . \nbut little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell . \nwalking out of the theater , i could see the audience\'s disgust . . . \none member even had to be awakened after the film ended . \ndon\'t believe the previews that you see . . . \nthis is definitely not a film for everyone . \nthis is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years . \nkids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline . \nthe plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us . \nit goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries . \nthink of the film city of angels . \nnow add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision . \nboth films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office . \ncosting around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it\'s money back . \nbut due to it\'s story , i doubt it will . \nfor everyone who thought titanic\'s story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well . \nbut don\'t get me wrong . . . \ni hope the film does do well . \nit\'s a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen . \ni doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind . \nwhat dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals . \nthe only film that surpasses it is dark city . \nfull of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to . \nbut don\'t do that , because you\'ll end up going to hell . \nwhat dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake . \nchris \" christy \" nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat . \nannie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married . \nannie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic . \nchris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself . \nthey also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock ) . \nbut one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie . \nshe tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution . \nchris copes with the problem by realizing they aren\'t around anymore , and nothing will change that . \njust as annie gets her life back in order , chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim . \nchris goes to heaven , or his version of heaven , rather . \nguided by albert ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy . \nthat is , until he realizes how miserable he is without annie . \nprior to heaven , he would try to comfort annie , but the more he was around , the more pain she felt . \nchris decides to leave her alone . \nlittle does he realize what will happen next . \ni\'m not about to say , because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story ( many critics , however , give it away ) . \ncertainly , chris dying is crucial to the plot , but they tell you that he dies in the previews . \nstory is not necessarily important for this movie to work , because it deals with the afterlife . \nhowever , strangely , virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil . \na couple of comments here and there , but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life . \n \" we\'re soul mates ! \" \nchris exclaims . \nheaven , in movies , is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white , purity , and love . \nusually , it also looks like it rests among the clouds . \nbut what dreams may come goes a different route . \nit shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before . \nchris\' heaven is his memories brought to life . \nhis thoughts can make anything real , and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven . \n \" i\'ve never seen anyone use real paint before , \" albert says . \nequally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone . \ninstead , it\'s a state of being . \nin one gloriously horrific scene , chris and his \" tracker \" ( max von sydow ) arrive at a sea of faces . \nthousands of heads are stuck above ground , their bodies somewhere else . \nmostly dead silent , some quips are made , almost as if to lighten the mood . \nit\'s truly a frightening sequence . \nproduction designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination . \nusing state of the art computer technology , worlds are created for exploration . \nsometimes , some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact . \nit\'s not necessary to be there , but we appreciate seeing it . \ncostume designer yvonne blake ( who also appears in the film ) has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes . \ncinematographer eduardo serra , whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove , has a difficult job , as most cinematographers do working with special effects . \nbut serra\'s entire universe is a computer generated image , and he does a masterful job . \nwriter ron bass , adapting from the novel by richard matheson , provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot . \nthe story is extremely vague in its details , allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning . \nand director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision . \nwhat dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience . \nyour average movie goer more than likely isn\'t used to expressionistic techniques . \nthe film will also definitely draw attention from religious people , but they shouldn\'t take it too far . \nit is , after all , just a movie . \nrobin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances , while his comedic roles have been suffering . \nhis comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff , but when is confined by a screenplay , he isn\'t quite as effective . \nbut drama is really his strong point , and you can see that here . \nit\'s doubtful he\'ll get another oscar nomination , but i wouldn\'t really mind if he did . \nthe real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land . \nthis may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention . \nit\'s also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination . \nhowever , the academy doesn\'t like to award performances for these types of films . \ncuba gooding , jr . has been better , but he\'s certainly not distracting . \nmax von sydow is underused , as are jessica brooks and josh paddock . \na treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear ( if they even recognize him ) as chris\' father lost in the sea of faces . \nit\'s not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film , considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images . \noverall , it\'s williams and sciorra\'s film . \nwhat dreams may come is rated pg-13 for thematic elements involving death , some disturbing images , language , and some partial nudity . \nthe film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience . \nsome will find the plot distracting . \nsome will find the visuals absolutely glorious . \nand some will find both . \nthe only real problem with the film , that i could see , was that it slows down considerably during the midsection , just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins . \nby the way , some controversy even surrounded the title , which was mistaken for a sexual term ( \" what \" becomes \" wet \" and you should understand ) . \nin actuality , the title is from a soliloquy in hamlet . \njust thought i should let you know . \n',pos
'one of the sweetest tales to ever be made , it\'s a wonderful life isn\'t perfect , but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results . \nprobably the greatest \" feel-good \" film of all time , it\'s a wonderful life aims for the heart , and strikes with a golden arrow . \non christmas eve , george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls . \nyou see , george is in trouble , and he has always helped others who needed it . \nthis one time , however , god answers his prayers , and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george . \nclarence has got his own problems , however . \nclarence is an angel without his wings , and each time the bell rings , the wings pass him by . \nthe bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel . \nbut before clarence can save george , he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey\'s life . \nwe see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother\'s life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else . \nwhen the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn\'t sold to the evil mr . potter ( barrymore ) , who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls . \none christmas , potter gets his chance . \nuncle billy bailey ( mitchell ) loses $8 , 000 of the bank\'s money . \nwithout the money , the bank must close down . \ngeorge is stuck in a tremendous bind , and contemplates suicide . \nclarence , the faithful servant , is there just to pick him up , and to show him what bedford would be like without george . \nthis is all a lead-in to the very famous last scene , where george finally sees what true happiness is about . \nit\'s a wonderful life does have its faults . \nthe movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men . \nthe sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90\'s , like something out of a revisionist look . \nall the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film . \nthere are , however , endearing moments in all of this . \ncapra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50\'s to make the movie remarkably enjoyable . \nthe story is hackneyed , and the ending feels , well , a little too sugarish . \nthere\'s this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything , especially the sequences where george is either in trouble , or helping somebody . \nit\'s a little too nice for my liking , at times . \nthere is , however , enough humor , enough wit , and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part , which would be the most difficult . \nbut watching it\'s a wonderful life is never boring or difficult : it\'s always interesting , right until the finale , which , for all its sugar , makes delightful sense and is beautifully done . \ncapra does have his monumental cliches , but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection . \ndonna reed is perfect as the loving , obeidient wife , and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr . potter . \neveryone else is magnificent , including bert and ernie ( ward bond and frank faylen ) . \nthere is a general sense of goodness , as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film , and they relish that . \nstewart , however , is the king of all of this . \nhe is sometimes awkward , especially when saying \" merry christmas \" to all objects , animate or inanimate . \nbut he is james stewart , and he\'s lovably delightful throughout the film . \nhave i complained ? \ni shouldn\'t have . \nthis is a really good movie . \nno , this is a great movie . \nbetter yet , this is a phenomenal movie . \nthere is a reason classics are invented : to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life . \nthis is one of those films . \nit is a \" feel-good \" movie , something people complain a little too much about . \nbut capra\'s reworking of \" a christmas carol \" is the greatest christmas movie of all time . \nthere , i\'ve said it . \ni have to admit , the first time i saw this , i saw it with my family , including my 11 year old kid sister . \nthey all loved it . \nthey loved george , his wife , his troubles , and the beautiful ending . \nis it a little too sugar-coated ? \nmaybe . \nno matter . \nthis is a film that should be watched time and time again , with families around a coffee table , and eggnog on the plate . \nit is a film that just makes you feel good about life , family , and hope . \nit is the perfect christmas film , flaws and all . \nit is frank capra\'s greatest acheivement , and that really does say a lot . \nfor about 121 out of 129 minutes , this movie is flawless . \nthe rest can be excused : no film is perfectly flawless . \ni can\'t get over how much i love this movie , and how much you will , after watching it , digesting it , and sitting with your family , appreciating how special life really is . \n',pos
'of circumcision , psychic wounds and the family sitcom \nthe opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film . \nthere\'s a guy\'s voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like , and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women . \nas his imagination plays o n , he ( and we ) picture these motley characters in a mix-and-match shuffle of unlikely marriages , businesswomen with bums , matrons with paint salesmen , the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy . \nit\'s not just a witty , funny summing up of the film \'s themes - you might not guess it yet , but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on . \nwhat starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction , gets taken on a road trip , put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash . \nthat may not sound so different from the average family sitcom , and the general idea of the film doesn\'t , at first , seem so wildly distant from standard-issue hollywood comedy : man who was adopted as a child ( ben still er ) sets out on a journey to meet his real parents , along with his wife ( patricia arquette ) , his baby , and a pretty psychology-researcher ( tea leoni ) in tow . \nvarious mix-ups , shenanigans , oddball characters and , yup , disasters follow . \nbut if you think you\'ve been here before , the dialogue and the direction ( by david o . russell , who made spanking the monkey ) take it into another dimension . \nthe dreaded t-name seems an inevitable reference point ( what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance ) but really the point is that the foot-massage master hasn\'t got a monopoly on plot twists and fast , funny , irreverent lines , or on the absurdities of ordinary speech . \nwhether it\'s about circumcision , psychic wounds , oral sex , carjacking , the beauties of the armpit area , or ronald reagan , the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention . \nthe best thing is how these words aren\'t just there for the punchlines , but are great precisely because they\'re said in character , like tea leoni\'s neurotically-charged psychobabbler who\'s able to say under assault , \" it\'s understandable if you find this threatening \" . \nthe cast is excellent throughout , and , rather than singling out anybody , kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting , with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission . \nthere are some elements of a woody allen film in this ( not to mention the hand-held camera and loose , improvisational feel of some scenes ) . \nlike allen , russell\'s interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children ( and everybody , really ) . \nstill , if you\'re expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la \" murphy brown \" / \" frasier \" / fill-in-the-blank-american-comedy , well , it won\'t happen . \nthe film sets up expectations like these , with the lead character\'s search f or his origins and his hopes of self-healing , only to knock them down . \nif the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one-ness , flirting with disaster\'s charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go . \nand that , the film suggests , is the essential family state - and you better learn to love it . \nsomehow , this is perversely feelgood cinema , right up to its manic end . \n',pos
'seen december 28 , 1997 at 8 : 45 p . m . at the crossgates mall cinema 18 ( guilderland , ny ) , theater #8 , with matt perreault and my sister jena for free ( matt paid using pre-paid passes ) . \nif there\'s ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non- stop action , the james bond films are it . \nand if there\'s ever been a james bond film that not only proves this , but does so by pushing it to the extreme , \" tomorrow never dies \" is it . \nopening sequences almost always make or break action films . \nwhen done properly , not only are they actually exciting , but they foreshadow things to come . \nthis film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie , but with a sense of the self-aware , enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in . \nfirst there\'s a high-tech , slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly , chinese waters . \nthere\'s definite tension as there seems to be an unknown , but certainly hostile , third party involved who is manipulating both sides . \nwhen the scene ends in tragedy , it\'s clear there\'s some kind of powerful conspiracy going on , and who else to call on for such a case but james bond ? \nthe film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond ( brosnon ) . \nas the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious , bond is clearly ( and obviously ) depicted as an out-and-out hero . \nhe single-handedly takes out a small army of terrorists , and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co-pilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down ! \nthis might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for ( over- ) using , but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly . \nit\'s not about the payoff because it\'s obvious bond will escape , instead , it\'s the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it , all the while creating for witty , hysterical comedy . \nit seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore , because of political correctness , and just plain copping-out on behalf of the filmmakers ( even the term \" villain \" sounds passe ) . \nwhat the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come , yet making him seem completely plausible . \njonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant , cunning elliot carver , a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world , that is , through his massive media empire , not through nuclear weapons . \nthrough some interesting detective work , bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news . \nnot only is that an original idea for a conflict , but one which could carry over into reality . \nsurprisingly , this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become . \nthe film\'s hook is the action , and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way . \nthe story works much like bond himself - always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot . \nsomehow a chinese agent , wai lin ( yeoh ) , bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together . \nthe chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid , but also works because of this , not in spite of it . \nthe two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons , yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story . \nalthough \" tomorrow never dies \" is far from perfect , it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue . \n',pos
'i\'m not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius . \nwhen tim burton\'s twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it\'s breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure . \nand when it doesn\'t work , it\'s just dull . \ni\'m not even sure it works more often than it doesn\'t , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks ! \nis brilliant . \nmars attacks ! \nis based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer\'s independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas . \nbut unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! \nhas a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it . \nthe big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! \nportrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are . \nthe title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation . \nthe spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman\'s thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping . \nit\'s so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing . \nthe movie lays low for the next 40 minutes . \nwe get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple-sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming . \nbut mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton . \nit\'s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton\'s just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars . \nanyone who comes to mars attacks ! \nexpecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses . \njack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer . rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr . strangelove\'s buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house\'s \" kennedy room , \" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big-haired , pointy-breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it\'s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy . \nsarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j . fox is her newsman husband . \nthe octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , \" they blew up congress ! \" \nand plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace . \njim brown and tom jones are the film\'s vegas-based heroes , and director barbet schroeder ( reversal of fortune ) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president . \nalso on hand and underutilized are annette bening , pierce brosnan , pam grier , lukas haas and natalie portman ( the latter two also show up in woody allen\'s everyone says i love you ) . \nthe real stars , of course , are the computer-generated martians , and they\'re fantastic . \nwith bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull-faces , round egg-eyes with red pupils darting this way and that , these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate -- joe dante\'s gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory , but burton\'s little monsters are more inventive . \nthe film\'s raison d\'etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans . \nthe sheer level of mayhem is staggering , especially when the aliens make their first attack , blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons . \nparents are urged to pay special attention to the pg-13 rating -- it\'s earned . \nthe special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy , and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day , although mars attacks ! \nwas in production long before that film\'s release . \ncinematographer peter suschitzky , who makes the most of wynn thomas\'s wildly imaginative production design ( thomas helped define the spike lee style ) , actually took time off from his mars attacks ! \nregimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg . \ncronenberg\'s movie will almost certainly be more somber -- it won\'t be released in the u . s . until early next year -- but mars attacks ! \nis surely a similarly elegant nightmare . \nthis is not a nice movie . \n ( and which studio executive was duped into giving burton $70 million to make it ? ) \nby setting the film\'s final scenes in the nearly empty , holocaust-ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided , burton\'s invasion epic suggests that the world we\'ve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead . \nthe victims of his invasion are naive , greedy , or disastrously self-absorbed -- and a good thing , too , since the movie\'s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish-fulfillment fantasy . \nthe surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers , who triumph by determining that the alien invaders -- the ultimate elitists -- are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture . \nultimately , this messy masterpiece is the year\'s funniest comedy and a weird , winking affirmation of the power of the people . \n',pos
'i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate , cuba\'s oscar nominee for best foreign film , directed by tomas gutierrez alea ( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo-- \" memories of underdevelopment \" . \ni saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late \'70s ; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition . \ni knew then that memorias was probably a state-sanctioned political missive , and now expect strawberry will follow suit . \nfellow internetters , primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba ( soc . culture . cuba ) , have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs . \ni have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line--it probably looks like political criticism , but it ain\'t so . \nhaving some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro\'s repressiveness , i can\'t conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution , and i can\'t imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement . \nas kids say these days , duh ! , the revolution\'s current state needs no criticism ; its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident . \nthe proper questions to put relate to castro\'s legitimacy . \ni bet the film takes castro\'s power for granted , and that this or any other movie , produced under cuba\'s state control , cannot question his right to run cuba\'s political show ( ongoing now for more than 36 years ) . \nthat\'s why i just can\'t believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime . \nlet\'s see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up . \ni saw the film--twice . \ni was right ; castro remained intact . \nstrawberry negotiates the relationship between a young \" dialectic materialist , \" as he describes himself , and a homosexual photographer ( diego ) in 1979 cuba . \nthe young man ( david ) is the son of peasants ; a symbol of the revolution\'s reason for being . \ngrateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education , he studies political science instead of literature , his avocation , because he perceives it is his duty . \ntherein lies a likely unintended irony , since cuba has no need for political theoreticians . \ncuba\'s government is castro . \ndiego\'s lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life . \nhe enjoys the finer things--tea , opera , art . \nhe does not do \" voluntary work \" for the revolution . \nhis small apartment is a sensual oasis . \nthe moniker \" bourgeois \" figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie . \nhowever , he is a \" revolucionario \" in his own way . \nthe supporting roles are filled by : an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche ; david\'s roommate , who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme ; david\'s ex-girlfriend , who dumped him for another guy , yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband ; german , a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit , and who strikes a faustian pact with the government . \ngutierrez alea and co-director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too . \nheck , towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor . \nhe really loves the revolution ( as supposedly does everybody else in cuba ) and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws . \nreal criticism is missing though . \nthis movie is political window dressing . \nluis aguilar leon\'s op . \ned . \npiece on fresa in the miami herald ( 10 march 1995 , at 21a ) did not color my judgment ; it presaged my intuition . \naguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this film\'s political angle best : like many artistic manifestations in cuba , strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment . \nas art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes , the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept \" the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point , while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point . \" \nalthough terrible propaganda , this is otherwise a fine film . \n',pos

\nfor shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners . \ndoes this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? \nthe answer to that question is not a very easy one , either . \nas far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable . \nit wasn\'t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached . \nfor unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before . \nthe story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan\'s direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving . \nthere are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis\' character and another train passenger . \nthe shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak . \nalso very impressive is the film\'s score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan\'s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year\'s dinosaur ) . \nseveral of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film . \none of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to \" exercise \" his powers . \nthe music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie . \nif there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it . \nthe film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment . \nwillis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can\'t seem to figure out why he\'s been depressed for the last few years . \nhis character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah\'s tutelage . \njackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah . \nthough his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked . \nrobin wright penn\'s role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character\'s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again . \nspencer treat clark , as the dunne\'s young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film . \nout of all the characters , jeremy\'s is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role . \nwhere the film does lose points though , is during its \" surprise \" ending . \nshyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying \" that was it ? ! \" \nwhen unbreakable revealed its own ending . \nit\'s not that the ending is bad , it\'s just that the ending doesn\'t quite have the emotional punch that the other film\'s did . \nplus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won\'t reveal the ending here , but you\'ll understand what i mean when you see it ) . \nessentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable . \nthe only real problem is that the ending doesn\'t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor . \nas long as it isn\'t held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film . \none thing seems clear , though . \nshyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film . \n',pos
'there\'s good news and bad news about mulan . \nthe positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules . \non the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast . \nbut mulan is a step in the right direction and disney\'s best animated feature since the lion king . \nafter giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians . \nmulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married . \nthat\'s what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her . \ncartoons . . . \nmeanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns . \nsince mulan\'s a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go . \nshe pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family . \nthat\'s chinese culture for you . . . \nso imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father\'s uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place . \nthe movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army . \nit should have been called g . i . \nchang . \nmulan calls on her ancestors for help . \nthey decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up . \nvoiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges . \nmurphy\'s performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they\'re going to have . \nyou ain\'t never had a friend like mushu . \nspeaking of songs , mulan doesn\'t have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this . \ndisney songs about war probably wouldn\'t go over too well ( \" heigh ho , heigh ho , it\'s off to war i go . . . \" ) , and the ones they do have aren\'t memorable . \nthe best of the bunch , sad to say , is \" be a man , \" the requisite basic training montage song . \nyes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle . \nsung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , \" be a man \" accompanies footage of mulan\'s platoon going from screw-ups to heroes . \nit makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that\'s ended badly ? \ni only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage . \nfor the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl . \nall she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder-length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china . \nthe deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year-old boy , at best . \nbut she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil-eyed attilla-looking monster . \nas a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable . \ni saw the movie yesterday and i don\'t remember the man\'s name . \notherwise , mulan is a good movie . \nthe animation of the characters themselves isn\'t as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots . \neddie murphy pulls off some good one-liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star . \nhell , george \" mr . sulu \" takei does a voice in mulan . \nyou get the sense disney said to themselves , \" alright , let\'s get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood . \nwho can you think of ? \" \n \" well , there\'s mr . myagi . . . \" \n \" good . \" \n \" and mr . sulu . \" \n \" perfect . \nwe\'ve got ourselves a movie now . \" \nsoon disney really _will_ be able to paint with all the colors of the wind . \n',pos
'with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the \" film noir \" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller\'s crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) . \ntheir latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . \nthe main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn\'t quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who\'s wise to the world , but he doesn\'t really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax . \nthat main character is jeffrey \" the dude \" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film\'s rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as \" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . \" \nthe dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who\'s in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody\'s cheating in a bowling match ( \" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! \" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who\'s always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( \" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! \" ) . \nthese three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of \" hotel california \" and , if it\'s possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . \nif that doesn\'t give you a good idea of this film\'s absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude\'s rug . \nthey\'ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . \nthe dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn\'t have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom . \nunfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude\'s car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money . \nsoon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german \" nihilists \" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . \nmeanwhile , the big lebowski\'s daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . \nthe plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc . \nthe previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival\'s \" run through the jungle , \" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . \nthe film doesn\'t feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens\' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude\'s dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . \nthe film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this \" jungle \" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . \nthere\'s also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his \" this aggression will not stand \" speech . \nthe coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( \" the bums will always lose ! \" \nshouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their \" peaceful beach community , \" and so on . \nby the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least \" aggression \" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on \" passive , \" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters . \nhe also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn\'t like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he\'s getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end . \nthe coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don\'t just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either . \ni think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained . \naudience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first . \n \" it\'s good knowin\' he\'s out there , the dude , takin\' it easy , \" posits the narrator towards the end . \ni dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken . \n',pos
'in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in . \nwe hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses\' hooves . \nwithout an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind\'s eye . \neven without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema . \nbut do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? \nexploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept . \nis the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? \nmidnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth . \nas joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration . \nduring the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo . \' \nas joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he\'s dead . \' \na troubled expression comes across joe\'s face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone . \nhaving adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody . \njoe\'s persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream . \nhe romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance . \nby the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing . \njust as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success . \nbut how realistic are these ideals ? \njoe had raped and been raped in texas . \nthe scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas . \nalongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation . \nthe ability to pack up one\'s belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention . \nschlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe\'s abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny . \nwe understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame . \nhe runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york . \nin the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe\'s encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself . \nstanding up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh . \nschlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe\'s virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation . \nbeyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin\'s first sexual encounter , a reference to joe\'s first homosexual liaison . \nthe fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe\'s emasculation . \nit is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men . \njoe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff . \' \nthere are two predominant images of new york . \nthe first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty . \nthe other new york is travis bickle\'s new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth . \njoe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter . \nmirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men . \njoe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions . \nthe people steal joe\'s money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity . \nwhat has become of joe\'s american dream ? \nschlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party . \njoe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex . \nat the party , all of joe and ratzo\'s desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami . \ncontrasting joe\'s daily struggles , shots of warhol\'s crew display wanton indulgence . \nthere is an irreverence in the partygoers\' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors . \nthe party makes a mockery of joe\' s ideals . \njoe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe\'s toils . \nthe american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent . \nas joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him . \nhis masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished . \nfor joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity . \ntossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami . \nthe final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window . \ninstead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe . \nreflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus\' window with joe hardly taking notice . \nthe scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before . \nthe world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream . \nno longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means . \nmidnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream . \nthere is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family . \nthen there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city . \njoe\'s attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york . \nduring his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man . \nan allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck\'s progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons . \n',pos
'susan granger\'s review of \" hearts in atlantis \" ( castle rock/warner bros . ) \ntiming is everything , and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the coming-of-age nostalgia of \" stand by me \" with the mystical power of \" the green mile . \" \nbased on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks , it\'s set in 1960 in harwich , connecticut , where fatherless 11 year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house with his resentful , self-centered mother ( hope davis ) . \nhe\'s devoted to his neighborhood friends ( mika boorem , will rothhaar ) but his pivotal relationship is with a strange , new tenant , ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins ) who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him , instead , a library card . \nknowing he\'s longing for a schwinn bike , ted offers to pay him $1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent , ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers . \nthe story structure consists of one long flashback , framed by the present , featuring the adult bobby ( david morse ) , minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins\' mysterious character is genteel , sensitive and benignly seductive . \nthe only explanation is that he\'s a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate , given the inexplicable state of the world right now . \nthe production values and performances are solid , particularly hopkins - arguably the finest , most versatile actor of our era - and the children with whom he forges a firm bond . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" hearts in atlantis \" is a wistful , enigmatic 8 , evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis . \n',pos

'plot : a peculiar french girl grows up lonely with her father and doesn\'t quite know what she wants out of life . \none day , she falls upon something , and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others . \nshe starts with the people around her , but when she suddenly falls for her own guy , she can\'t act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature . \ncritique : a clever , quirky , original french flick set in a picturesque paris , featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination , much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone . \nthis is a \" feel-good \" kind of movie , a fairy tale for grown-ups who are bummed out about life . \nit doesn\'t pretend to be deep , it doesn\'t weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters , it\'s basically just a \" cute movie \" in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward , with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions ( and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year ( a sham on so many different levels ) , you might as well slap this film up for consideration also , since it\'s quite a bit better and much more original than the former ) . \none thing that this film isn\'t though , at least according to me , is the best film of the year ( it was bestowed the honor of \" best \" in at least 3 different film festivals so far this year ) . \nit actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long ( it\'s a little over two hours but it felt even longer ) , with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters , all of whom weren\'t as interesting as the lead , and a lot of indecisiveness from ms . amelie herself , which got frustrating . \nthankfully , this film doesn\'t bog itself down with too much of that stuff , and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes , to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kind-hearted french girl . \non the whole , it\'s a lot of fun and it carries a beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man . \nthe lead , audrey tautou , is perfect for the role , and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film . \nunfortunately , the rest of the cast isn\'t as well-developed , and even though most of them are pretty appealing , a couple could\'ve been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plot-wise , by the film\'s end ( what happened to the guy in the caf ? who was spying on his ex-girlfriend the whole movie ? ) . \nnow i haven\'t seen too many recent french films , i will admit , but if this is the kind of \" scene \" that they\'re developing over in \" le pays du vin \" , i wouldn\'t mind catching more of their flicks in the future ( crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year , which i really liked- ironically , that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz , who is the co-star in this film ) . \ngranted , the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times ( i speak and understand french also , but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head ) , especially since the film\'s visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn\'t help but constantly gawk at them , but the general idea , the background music , the nifty french neighborhoods , the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the story-line from the start , were all very easy to appreciate , and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world . \nin fact , i\'d recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol\' time at the movie house , with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot of imagination , a little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts . \nand this guy directed alien : resurrection ? \nget outta here ! ! \nnote : i especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the loves/hates of everyone with exact mentions in the film . \nit was very original , very well shot and very nostalgic , as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described . \ngood stuff ! \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ? \nchocolat ( 6/10 ) - crimson rivers ( 8/10 ) - ghost world ( 9/10 ) - like water for chocolate ( 8/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - pay it forward ( 5/10 ) - rushmore ( 9/10 ) - woman on top ( 7/10 ) \n',pos
'with many big-budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting . \nthe fifth element , the abyss , and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting , writing , or both . \nat first glance , the matrix , larry & andy wachowski\'s sci-fi/kung-fu/shoot-em-up spectacular , looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high-concept bad movies , especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role . \nbut despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue , the matrix works . \nit\'s an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout . \nreeves plays neo , a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with \" trinity \" ( carrie-anne moss ) , a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks , a unseen , omniscient cult figure known as \" morpheus \" ( lawrence fishburne ) , and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell . \nneo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems . \nmoreover , he discovers that the grim , bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it . \nneo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah , with grave doubts that he is actually \" the one \" prophesized to come and save the world . \nreluctant or not , what follows is a mix of hong kong-style slow-motion shootouts , surreal dream sequences , high speed chases , and comic book kung-fu fights . \nthe film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality . \nhow exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind ? \nand if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in , would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion ? \nunfortunately , the matrix doesn\'t provide many answers to the questions it raises , but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions , shoot-outs , and flying roundhouse kicks . \nperhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving , who plays agent smith , the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix . \nweaving\'s stony appearance , deadpan voice , and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting , evil technological force that controls the matrix . \nlike robert patrick as the shapeshifting t-1000 terminator in terminator 2 : judgement day , weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because , despite his power and seeming invincibility , he looks ordinary , even scrawny . \nweaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence . \nthe film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography . \nit seems to be deliberately kitchy , with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors . \nin a few scenes , the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny . \njust seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring . \nhowever , with the comic-book style and tone of the film , you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience . \nthe matrix isn\'t a classic . \nits open-ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers . \nit fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions . \nit also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero - the kind of shmaltzy feel-good goo that most of the film avoids . \nreportedly , the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel . \nunfortunately , audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future . \nthe matrix is an fun , enjoyable diversion , like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival . \njust don\'t be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry . \n',pos
'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nmilos forman\'s first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia\'s the people vs . \nlarry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s . \nthe film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky . \ncut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati . \nthe strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter . \nthis evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history . \nwhat sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost . \nthe people vs . \nlarry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt\'s true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations . \nconsidering the serious nature of the film\'s theme - the importance of the united states\' first amendment - the people vs . \nlarry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous . \nmuch of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt\'s outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity . \nthe film\'s focus is on the flynt\'s many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs . \nlarry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea . \nlarry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side . \nthere\'s a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking . \nultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea\'s love for each other . \nwoody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt . \nharrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film . \ncourtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn , completely raw and impulsive . \nit\'s a very solid performance , brash and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it\'s difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead-on . \nedward norton , as flynt\'s straight , level-headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co-stars in the people vs . \nlarry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film . \none can sense the frustration that norton\'s character feels when harrelson\'s free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton\'s isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges . \nmilos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic . \nthere\'s also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining . \ntwo minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs . \nlarry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech . \nconsequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and setting up the characters , seem unduly rushed ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion . \nit also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a superficial level some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level . \nfor example , why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton ( president carter\'s sister ) to be born-again is a mystery to me . \nthen again , perhaps it was to him as well . \nthese two points don\'t detract greatly from the film . \nthe people vs . \nlarry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story . \n',pos
'the happy bastard\'s quick movie review \nme tarzan . . . you \nhappy viewer . \nfor a minute there , i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney\'s latest , another adaptation of a legend from the past . \n ( remember the pathetic pocahontas ? \nyikes ! ) \nbut guess what- disney , a company that\'s been on a roll lately with animated films , strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you . \nthe story is pretty basic- tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who\'s lost her young adopts him into her group . \nas he matures into a much older man , tarzan still wonders just why he\'s so much different from the clan , and then arrives a hunter , a professor , and the professor\'s lovely daughter , jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons . \nfrom there , tarzan faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england ? \nthe voicework here is pretty top-level . \ntony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man ; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already-beautiful jane ; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice ; rosie o\' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan\'s best ape friend terk ; and wayne \" newman \" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant . \nthe movie is superb throughout , mixing a great script with incredible computer-assisted visuals . \nwhen tarzan tree-surfs ( a twist that was added on top of the same ol\' vine swinging- and a great one , i might add ) , the camera twists and turns , allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly . \ni couldn\'t believe my eyes- disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast . \nand the music\'s not half bad , either . \nfortunately , there\'s no ridiculous singing characters here , just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood . \nthere\'s some great action sequences here as well , including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan , jane , and the aforementioned babboons . \nbut , of course , it\'s not all action- there\'s a message here as well that has to do with family . \nthis is easily one of disney\'s best animated films of the decade and it\'s one i can\'t wait to put in my home library . . . that \nis , if my vcr still works in the year 2000 . \n',pos

'kevin smith is like a big kid . \nhis humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile\'s . \nhe grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books , having also written a few . \nhe also has a cult following , mostly composed of teenagers , college students , and smith\'s own fellow adolescent-minded grownups . \nsmith is hilarious in person and in writing , but when he tries to be earnest and moralize , that is when he goes wrong . \nkevin smith is a better writer than director , and he\'ll be the first to tell you that . \nthat might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy-handed . \ngreat directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them . \nthis was true in the overrated chasing amy , and it is true for dogma as well . \nthat is not to say smith\'s message is a bad one . \nin dogma , smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god\'s desires is superior to anyone else\'s . \nbasically , dogmatism is bad . \nchanging the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or not . \nthis is not exactly a new message in movies ( see inherit the wind ) , but i have no problems with recycling old ones , particularly since dogma\'s protesters are proving smith\'s point . \nsmith\'s own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book . \nbut this is smith\'s personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc . ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns . \nthe story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god , metatron ( alan rickman ) , to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels , bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death , loki ( matt damon ) . \nalong the way , forgotten thirteenth apostle , rufus ( chris rock ) , stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek ) , and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethany\'s aid . \nfallen muse , azrael ( jason lee ) , proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery . \nthe logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith\'s points , and in itself , has little dramatic momentum . \namong the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman , jesus was black , and the bible was written by a bunch of racist , misogynistic white men . \nof course , kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself . \nthey are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic . \nsmith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie . \nwhen harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes , smith thought it might give validation to protesters\' claims that the film was sacrilegious , but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke . \nthe film\'s humor is uneven . \nsome parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance . \nbut many of the film\'s jokes just bomb , as in virtually anything involving salma hayek\'s serendipity . \nalso , some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away . \nstill , smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace . \namong the actors , fiorentino and rickman stand out by far . \nfiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight . \ndamon and affleck are fairly lackluster . \nrock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith . \nbut the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob , who recur in all of smith\'s movies , are much more in line with smith\'s brand of humor . \nbud cort , george carlin , janeane garofalo , guinevere turner , and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances . \n',pos
'brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly . \nsince scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames . \nconsequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito\'s way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes . \nit doesn\'t hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn . \ncarlito\'s way , while hampered by depalma\'s characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama . \ncarlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance . \nin 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality . \nhe declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas . \namong those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito\'s crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) . \ncarlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace . \nold ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can\'t seem to shake . \ncarlito\'s way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film . \nin the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station . \nboth highlight depalma\'s gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely . \nyet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling . \ncarlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit . \nbut where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there\'s more of an immediacy to carlito\'s way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion . \nyou sense that there\'s no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble . \nindeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : \" you don\'t get reformed ; you just run out of wind . \" \npacino captures carlito\'s dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy . \nsean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld . \na jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder . \nhe could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct . \nhe shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting . \nas compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu . \ndepalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas . \nhe even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . \nfrom a story standpoint , there\'s an obligatory love story with a cliche\'d long-suffering girlfriend character . \npenelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn\'t do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story . \nstill , it\'s easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid . \nthe two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn\'t break . \ncarlito\'s way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful . \nthose willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded . \n',pos
'a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today\'s youth seem attracted to black culture . \nthe review \nif black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act . \nhowever , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that . \nblack & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america\'s youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious . \nfeaturing a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr . ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback\'s is a complex film worth seeing . \nblack & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman . \nthere is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game . \nthis eventually spills over into the life of dean\'s long-time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem . \nrich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white-owned club on his turf . \nmeanwhile , the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr . ) . \nothers who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will , joe pantoliano as his district attorney father , jared leto as a high school teacher , marla maples as the mother of one of hip-hop crazed teens , claudia schiffer as dean\'s girlfriend , and mike tyson as . . . \nmike tyson . \nthe stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time . \nfriendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence . \noriginally rated nc-17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls . \nwhile the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing . \nthe three-way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for , and several audience members got up and left at that point . \nthe frequent sex is one of the film\'s few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film . \nto toback\'s credit , the level of violence in black & white is almost nil . \nthese gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and concerns , and only become gun-toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way . \nwhenever a character finds himself on donager\'s handheld digital camera , he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence , but not everyone has fully bought into the idea . \ncharlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop , but admits that \" in ten years time , i\'ll be way over this . \" \nthese youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it . \ntoback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny . \nmost of the humour comes from mike tyson , who provides the film\'s comic relief without really trying . \nhe is given big words like vernacular to say , and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson , he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better , playing on tyson\'s image as a dimwit . \nbut tyson also gets the film\'s scariest moment . \nas he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry , tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm . \nthe scene is entirely improvised , with downey jr . being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction . \nthe reaction he gets , being slapped and then choked is astonishing , as downey jr\'s face turns a frightening shade of purple . \nblack & white is a film about hip-hop culture , and the film\'s omnipresent hip-hop soundtrack strongly supports this . \nbut toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does , toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character\'s struggle . \nthus black & white\'s message about hip-hop becomes secondary to the film itself . \ntoback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip-hop along the way . \nand we do . \n',pos
'at first glance , three kings looks to be just another war movie , the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember . \nthe 90s version , it definitely is , just another war movie ? \nnot in your dreams ! \nimagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan , thats three kings for you . \nbelieve it or not , it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter . \nthe story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war , with the allied troops victorious . \nmajpr archie gates ( clooney ) leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post-war looting spree ; the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert . \nas the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home , this `wild bunch goes awol on an armed hum-vee ( the vehicle of choice of the us army ) . \nthey soon find out that they have much resistance , as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces . \nfrequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men , they become consciously attacked by their own morals . \nas the film begins to roll , it seemed to have a rather `light mood to it . \n`special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light-hearted funny action movie . \nthree kings is much smarter than that . \nas the conflict becomes more and more complex , the audience will be trapped in a limbo , trying to stay focussed on that light-mood/serious-mood that the film seem to portray . \ni personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film ; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity . \nthis simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant . \naction sequences are not shot as your old-fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs in-your-face war violence . \nthey are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close-ups and pauses , right before the action starts . \nnot john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style ( tons of them starring clint eastwood ) . \ngreat performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film ; the screenwriter and the director . \nthree kings ranks among the best films of the year , well , for me at least . \nhighly recommended . \n',pos
'there is a scene early in soul food , george tillman\'s comedy-drama about a large african-american family and the ordeals they go through during a crisis , that caught me completely off guard . \nduring a wedding , the groom is flirting with some tramp , and in an attempt to to prevent a scene , his mother in law , played by irma p . hall , comes to the rescue . \nthe way in which she does this makes me think irma p . hall is one of the greatest actresses around right now . \nhowever , this is just one magical moment in a movie filled with them . \nvanessa williams , vivica fox , and nia long star as three sisters who have each gone their own way in life . \nwilliams is teri , a successful lawyer , who is frustrated by her husband miles attempts at a music career . \nfox is maxine , the strongest of the sisters , which can be confirmed by the stability of her marriage and the wisdom of her son ahmad , who narrates the film . \nlong is bird , a hairdresser who is the last of the three to get married . \nher husband lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper gets the best of him sometime but never stops loving . \nat the center of everything is irma p . hall , as big mama jo . \nevery sunday , the family gathers together for dinner at mama jo\'s house . \nthere is lots of conversation , lots of laughs , and the occasional controversy . \nmama jo presides over the family like all mothers should . \nshe is stern and disciplined , but also caring and forgiving . \neverything is going fine , until a tragedy befalls mama jo . \nall of a sudden , a chain reaction of events begin to destroy the family . \nit gets so bad , sunday dinner is even cancelled . \nwithout mama jo\'s guidance , there is noone to keep the family together , which frustrates ahmad . \nmiles and maxine\'s marriage begins to fall apart , as he focuses on his music and flirts with the troublesome faith . \nlem\'s temper gets the best of him when his convict past starts to catch up to him . \nand teri tries to prevent maxine\'s efforts to sell mama jo\'s house . \nthe third act of the film deals with ahmad\'s attempts to patch things up . \nhe decides to take over where mama jo left off , and tries to get the family back together for one more sunday dinner . \nthe acting by everyone in the ensemble is outstanding , with special notices to irma p . hall and brandon hammond . \nhall gives a performance that deserves to be recognized by the academy . \nher mama jo is one of the most memorable characters i have ever encountered in a movie . \nbrandon hammond is an actor with a bright future . \nhe is wise enough not to play cutesy and shows an admirable range and depth , and speaks the final lines of the movie on the perfect note . \ntillman obviously based this movie on his own memories of growing up . \nevery scene in the movie is purposeful and convincing ( except maybe an odd flashback sequence ) . \nthe dialogue is beleiveable and funny . \nand then there\'s the food . \ntillman gives us several close ups of the soul food , and it indeed looks very tasty . \ni can see why sunday dinners became such a tradition for this family . \nsoul food is one of the most purely entertaining movies of the year . \n',pos
'i have a soft spot in my heart for pure , amoral sleaze . \ni liked showgirls ( there , i said it ) . \ni typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz , sex-filled cinematic tabloid-ish trash . \nwild things is the best sleazy film i\'ve ever seen . \nit\'s filled with great performances , graphic sex , three-way sex , rape charges , double-crosses , plot twists , genitalia of all genders , graphic violence , death , witty humor , and , best of all , denise richards . \ncriticizing this film for being disgusting , raucous , and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing , or titanic for being lofty and epic . \nwild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors , but i don\'t just admire it for this--i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies . \ni must admit up-front , however , that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal . \ni imagine that this shows . \nit\'s hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn\'t be known . \ni thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer , but i was wrong ; there are a lot of turns here . \ni\'ll just say that the film takes place in blue bay , a rich little town in florida . \nin blue bay lives sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students , kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , and suzie toller ( neve campbell ) . \nkelly\'s mother , sandra ( theresa russell ) , immediately presses charges . \nall of this happens fairly early in the film . \nand right up until this point , i had the whole film predicted . \ni was wrong , though , and every time i was proven wrong , i was shocked . \nwild things isn\'t even remotely plausible , but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless , and often invited , just for kicks . \ni remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers . \ni\'d give the preview four stars . \nit made me want to see the movie so much that i\'ve been waiting for it anxiously ever since . \nover the past few weeks though , i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview ( see independence day ) ; thankfully , i was proven wrong . \nthe preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company : not only does it make us want to see the film , but it doesn\'t give away any of the secrets . \nbut i\'m not here to talk about the preview . \ni\'m here to talk about denise richards . \nnow , i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers , but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she\'s in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can . \nof course , this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes . . . and \nflawless body . . . but \ni thought she did a great job acting , too ( stop laughing ) . \nno , richards is truly a find--she is talented , and always convincing in this film . \nthis mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future . \nthe other actors are good , too . \ndillon is as suave as ever ( it\'s nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in & out ) . \nbacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer . \nneve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them , though i won\'t pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex . \nfor a plot like this to work , all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived . \nthat\'s okay , because director john mcnaughton knows that he\'s making a self-consciously wicked film . \neach scene--even the three-way sex scene--is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton , and the result is a sleaze-fest that\'s too smart to resist . \nthere isn\'t an inconsistent moment in wild things : every bit of it is alluring garbage , so trashy it\'s funny , and so entertaining it\'s painful . \ni loved it . \n',pos
'what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker . \nthe dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! \ni can hear batfans everywhere protesting : \" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! \" \nand , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play . \nnicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman . \nnicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the \'60s tv series ) . \non one hand , nicholson\'s joker is extremely funny . \nhis murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film . \nbut on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind . \nthe joker\'s cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister . \nthis guy is off his rocker , and he not only knows it , he flaunts it ! \nbut enough about nicholson as the joker : i\'m sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman . \nlike many , i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader . \nbut batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting ! \nkeaton delivers . \nhe is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman . \neven though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city . \nvisually , batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team . \nthe movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak , gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as \" the dark knight returns \" and \" the killing joke . \" \nburton\'s film is a feast for the eyes ; the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen . \nthe sets , costumes , and make-up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations . \nnicholson isn\'t joking when he boasts , \" wait \'till they get a load of me ! \" \nhis grimacing smile , green hair , and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous . \nkeaton\'s wardrobe is equally appropriate . \nbatman\'s cape , mask , and body armor make him look threatening , frightening , and invincible bringing to mind not adam west\'s campy costume in the tv series but peter weir\'s outfit in robocop . \nproduction designer anton furst\'s sets are a wonder . \ngotham city is dark and foreboding , almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york . \nthe batcave is cold , bare , and desolate . \nthe world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption . \nthe movie\'s gritty bladerunner/robocop look is a joy to behold . \nthe plot , on the other hand , is not as rousing . \nthe screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting . \nit takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear . \nbatman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology , but it fails to give us enough of either one . \nas i mentioned earlier , the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker , but it never fully establishes batman\'s psychological motives and underpinnings . \nin terms of action , batman is not as thrilling as you might expect . \nburton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story . \nmore than anything , batman is a mood film . \nwhile batman may not completely absorb and excite you , it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books . \nthanks to its distinctive look , the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world . \n',pos
'we all know the fate of \" child\'s play , \" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell . \nwith the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be \" bride of chucky \" - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ) , it\'s kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about . \nalas , the original \" child\'s play \" actually isn\'t that bad . \neven seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasn\'t the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don\'t believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this isn\'t a bad movie . \nit\'s not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don\'t have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , \" i know what you did last summer \" has recently gone . \nthe premise of \" child\'s play \" is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid\'s doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kid\'s doll i\'ve ever seen . \nthe next day , a bum who\'s stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday . \nof course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up . \nlike the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll , that being andy . \nand soon enough , chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun , and people are discovering that chucky isn\'t just a kiddie doll one by one . \nthe idea is a neat one , ripe for lots of comic terror , and luckily it utlizes a lot of that . \nit plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive , they tell people about it , but when he tries to prove themselves , chucky does nothing , and everyone thinks they\'re crazy . \nit plays with this , as well as the whole child-like thought that dolls and toys come to life , and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments . \neven if there\'s an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise , goes to investigate it , and finds nothing , but wait for the kicker a second later ! ) , \nthere\'s also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat , and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes , leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience . \nthe ending is rather fun , as well , albeit a tad too drawn-out ( about four different endings , maybe five ) , and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line-up , making them easier to sympathize with . \nif there\'s one horrible thing about many horror films , it\'s that the protagonists are morons who you can\'t help but shout obscenities at , and for the most part , \" child\'s play \" steers away from that . \nand most of all , the chucky character is a good one , not just because he provides instant comic relief ( look ! \nthat doll\'s moving on its own ! ) , but because he\'s a generally scary character . \nif there\'s anything really wrong with \" child\'s play , \" it\'s that it\'s too trite and has too less self esteem . \nat almost 90 minutes , \" child\'s play \" features way too less to be a real classic of horror . \nit throws itself into a simple three act set-up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it weren\'t for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll . \nif the film had more confidence in what it was presenting , it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism , which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film . . . which \nisn\'t necessarily a bad thing . \nas such , \" child\'s play \" is content to be just the short , typical horror film , but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasi-campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short , typical horror film . \n',pos

'tone alone cannot sustain a film , but it can go a long way . \nif i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story , it scores immediate style points . \nwhen that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting , the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly : \" literary . \" \nwhat\'s eating gilbert grape ? \nis such a film . \nit\'s a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence . \ngilbert grape ( johnny depp ) is a young man living in rural endora , iowa , facing incredible responsibilities . \nas the man of the house since his father\'s suicide , gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store . \nhe also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie ( leonardo dicaprio ) and help care for his extremely overweight mother ( darlene cates ) . \ngilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky ( juliette lewis ) , a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down . \nas he spends time with becky , gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing . \nslowly his resentment builds , until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people . \ndirector lasse hallstrom ( my life as a dog ) and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges\' screenplay , based on his own novel . \nendora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart , a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else . \nthe midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real . \nminor characters , like crispin glover as the town\'s mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen\'s desperately unhappy housewife . \none of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise , attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off-key high school band . \nnot a single note in the depiction of endora rang false . \nthe same can be said of the character of gilbert . \nit\'s testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert\'s description of his father with , \" i knew someone like that once . \" \ngilbert is a man harboring an ever-growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life , a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty . \nin one scene , he allows local children to look at his mother through their window , displaying her like a side show attraction . \nhis entire life seems to be mocked by arnie\'s repeated chants of , \" we\'re not going anywhere , \" but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer , and it becomes clear that he is following in his father\'s footsteps in this regard . \njohnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands . \ndepp\'s performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio\'s astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie . \nhe puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real . \ndicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal , and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard-pressed to spot a flaw . \ndarlene cates , a first-time actor , brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert\'s tortured mother , and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert\'s sisters . \nonly juliette lewis doesn\'t quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark . \ngilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me . \nthanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait . \n',pos

'along his carreer , mel gibson has collected several successes , not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view . \nfor all that , i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart . \nthe australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace , a popular scotch hero of the 13th century , where he would also perform the principal role . \naccepting so huge challenge , mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years , with a suppoosed failure , just to see recognized , by everyone , all his potentialities and , that way , to consolidate his position in hollywood . \nit was , definitely , an enormous risk but i\'m sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face . \nbraveheart is , in fact , a magnificent and magisterial film . \nfor three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative\'s rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest . \nthe william wallace\'s story is the story of so many others brave liberty\'s defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value , along the centuries . \nseeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression , william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i , king of england , in a war by the autonomy of scotland . \nas the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up . \nhis courage and inteligence are admired by everyone , including the princess isabelle of wales , wife of edward\'s son . \nhowever , william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought . \nbraveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty , nowadays . \nmel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast . \npatrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i , the king longshank . \nthe scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good . \nsophie marceau , as princess isabelle , has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart . \ni also liked the performances of angus macfadyen , as robert the bruce , and , of course , mel gibson , as william wallace . \nhowever , i think this time the mel gibson\'s work as director was much better than his work as actor . \nthe excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is . \nwhen we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes , view by the camera of john toll , then we realize all the beauty of this film . \nbraveheart is , in my opinion , one of the best movies of 1995 ! \ni\'ve heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean . \nfor now , let\'s see if braveheart equalizes the 6 oscars of lawrence of arabia . \nit won\'t be easy ! \nit\'s gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson . \n',pos
'capsule : bleak and point-blank -- just the way it should be . \nmakes its case with cold-blooded precision and intelligence . \n \" serial killer chic \" is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary , and one of the more stomach-turning ones . \ni\'ve never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers , and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry . \ni wasn\'t sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero/antihero . \nthankfully , that\'s not the way henry works . \nthe director , john mcnaughton , took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work . \nit doesn\'t provide cheap-jack explanations for henry\'s behavior : it shows him up for what he is , an unrepentant and un-idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him . \nat the film\'s opening , henry\'s friend ottis toole has a sister , who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago . \nin a viciously riveting scene , he admits matter-of-factly to having murdered his own mother , and she covers his hand with hers . \nthey are damned together from that moment on . \nhenry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun . \nthe movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it : there\'s a scene where the two go to buy a new tv . \nthe pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words , and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron . \nno preface -- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker . \nin a scene which many damned the movie for , unseen , they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household , playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment . \nthe movie itself , however , does not glorify the killings , but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work , only irritation . \nhenry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting . \nmichael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame , just standing there , and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well . \nthe producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton , but he decided to give them something more memorable , and consequently the film nearly didn\'t see release . \nthe film does not glorify or justify -- it just shows us , with unflinching coldness , what henry was . \ni\'m hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of \" victim \" or \" hero \" . \nthen again , probably , so would henry . \n',pos
'for the first reel of girls town , you just can\'t get over lili taylor . \nis it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student ? \nharder still , can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part ? \nwith the sure , showy expertise of a de niro , taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck-you confidence she can muster . \nit\'s a deeply felt , dead-on performance , and by the halfway point you\'ve forgiven taylor her own maturity . \nfor all its verite pretenses , girls town is less about a bunch of high-schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer-performers examining their own feelings about rape , relationships , and american womanhood . \nthe movie\'s opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart/sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation : patti , angela ( bruklin harris ) , emma ( anna grace ) , and nikki ( aunjanue ellis ) . \nbut about 10 minutes into the film , we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life . \nthe remaining girls manage to smug nikki\'s diary out of her grieving mother\'s home , and page through it at patti\'s place , investigating the root of nikki\'s despair . \nwhat they find is cruel and galvanizing -- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned , and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen . \nshell-shocked by the truth of the matter , the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives . \nemma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player . \npatti\'s barely sympathetic , wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock\'s car . \nand anyway , patti\'s had her own share of guys who wouldn\'t take no for an answer . \npained , acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry -- angry about the impossibility of saying no , and angry with themselves for being weak , for being naive , for putting up with it . \n \" why do we put up with it ? \" \nemma finally asks , once the argument has reached a fever pitch . \n \" we try to talk about it , and look what happens . \nwe fight for 20 minutes . \" \nthere\'s the admirable crux of this picture . \ngirls town is a political film , in that it calls for action . \nbut it\'s incomplete-it\'s never quite sure how to justify that action , or what form it should take . \nthe trio become crusaders for their right to dignity , and it\'s surely one of this year\'s most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passenger-side window of that damn jock\'s car ( doing the right thing ? ) . \nthey hang out in the bathroom , chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall . \n \" subvert the patriarchy , \" emma writes , and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to . \nthe girls silence their hecklers , take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti\'s child , and eventually come face-to-face with nikki\'s tormentor . \nstill , the movie has a desperately unfinished quality , and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying . \n ( you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls , but nobody thinks of it . ) \nperhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand , the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah ( \" who you callin\' a bitch ? \" ) . \nthe points are well taken , but they should have been unnecessary . \nlong on characterization but a little short on story , girls town is less than it could have been , and too self-congratulatory for my own taste . \ndirector jim mckay is best known as a consort of r . e . m . \'s \nmichael stipe ( he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band ) , and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking . \nthe movie was created and scripted by committee , but mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when , predictably , the group couldn\'t secure funding . \nthen again , girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film . \nthe movie\'s slapdash quality is key to its significance . \ntruth be told , all three of the leads look too wise for high school , but that\'s ok -- there\'s a once-removed quality to their fine , spontaneous performances , as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were , the girls they wish they had been , or some combination . \nfor all its flaws , this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place . \n',pos
'time bandits , from director terry gilliam , is a very different fantasy action/adventure movie about a group of time-traveling dwarves , led by randall ( david rappaport ) , who have stolen a map of the universe . \nthis map contains time hole , that , if exploited , enable the men to travel back and forth through time . \nthe supreme being of the universe ( ralph richardson ) is the former employer of these treasure-seeking bandits , and he wishes desperately to regain the map . . \nduring the travels , he appears as a ghostly face , demanding that they return the map that they have stolen . \nbut , according to randall , they are just \" borrowing \" it . \nkevin , a young boy who seems quite bored with his life , is unexpectedly brought into the schemes of the little men when they appear in his room , which has a portal for time traveling . \nhe joins up with the men and becomes part of their gang , following them on their robberies . \ntheir first victim is napoleon ( ian holm ) , whom they rob during a battle that he is commanding . \nfrom here , the group travels to the middle ages , meeting up with robin hood himself . \neventually , kevin is separated from the group and travels to an egyptian time where he is taken in by king agamemnon , played by sean connery . \nkevin accidentally saved the king\'s life , and the king wishes to have kevin as his son . \nbut the group of bandits find kevin and transport onto the deck of the titanic . \nmeanwhile , the evil genius ( david warner ) is watching the group from fortress of ultimate darkness , attempting to find a way in order to bring the men , and the map , to him . \nwhen randall learns of the fortress of ultimate darkness , which supposedly contains \" the most fabulous object in the world \" , the dollar signs seemingly appear on his eyes , as he is convinced that they must travel there . \nonce inside the fortress of ultimate darkness , it is unclear as to if any of the men will make it out alive . \ntime bandits is a fantastically made film that caters to the imagination of anyone . \nwith a terrific soundtrack , courtesy of george harrison , whom also was an executive producer , time bandits is sure to be a very surrealistic , time-traveling adventure with unforgettable characters that is sure to entertain anyone . \nterry gilliam , however , does not utilize that greatly his trademark ability in moviemaking during this film , although this does not affect the film that greatly . \nand finally , if you liked labyrinth , you\'ll love time bandits . \n',pos
'a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal . \na soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another . \na common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain . \na terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end . \nif the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues . \nit is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label . \nedward zwick\'s the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states . \nyou\'d think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines . \narab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack . \nhowever , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden\'s camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal . \nin retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world . \nunwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau\'s new york office at one federal plaza . \nwhile investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information . \ngenerally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm . \neven spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country . \nhubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government . \nthe original tagline for patriot games was , \" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . \" \nhowever true , it was pulled before the movie\'s release because it sounded too much like a dare . \nrevisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america . \nadmittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who\'s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid . \ni liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order . \nit provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself . \nin fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk . \nalthough it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups . \nthroughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully . \nwhat results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides . \nit actually gets rather heady at times , but it\'s a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don\'t underestimate the intelligence of the audience . \ni don\'t know if it\'s his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great . \nthis , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable . \nannette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i\'ve seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable . \nit\'s somewhat unfortunate that her character\'s fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range . \nbruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face . \nhowever , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film\'s development . \nnotable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant . \nthe role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society . \ndifficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch . \nperhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom \" wings , \" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night . \nwhereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick\'s favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer . \ni therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner\'s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most . \nrevell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole . \nit\'s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we\'ve been getting throughout the year . \nmissteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes . \nfor example , it\'s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick . \nunfortunately , there\'s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching . \nin the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops . \nverisimilitude really goes out the window at that point . \nthe film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along . \na noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously . \nthese flaws are glaring , but they don\'t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class . \n',pos
'while watching \" shallow grave , \" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens\' \" blood simple . \" \nboth are good films in which several characters , none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil , indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes . \nthe body count rises , and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands . \nboth films are also flawed , but for different reasons . \n \" blood simple \" is unrelentingly dark and moody , but its characterizations were a little hollow . \n \" shallow grave , \" on the other hand , is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes , and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they\'d accomplished for a more standard , audience-pleasing ending . \nthe events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time , yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end . \nas the film begins , we are introduced to alex ( ewan mcgregor ) , juliet ( kerry fox ) , and david ( christopher eccleston ) , a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow . \nthey are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious , but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch . \na man named hugo moves into the apartment\'s remaining vacancy , and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose . \njuliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash ( presumably from criminal activities ) . \nthe three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death ; after a drawing of straws , the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david , who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning . \nall of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film , and part of what makes \" shallow grave \" so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next . \nother than the obvious question of why they don\'t report the death and simply hide the cash , which is not addressed , the plotting and characterization , while sometimes predictable , worked in a way that kept my attention and , on more than one occasion , gave me chills . \ni will , therefore , attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn\'t give away too much of the plot . \nbroadly , the trio are in danger due to hugo\'s underworld connections , as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process . \na police inspector ( ken stott ) is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment , asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective . \ndavid , meanwhile , becomes increasingly paranoid , moves into the attic , and develops an affinity for sharp objects . \ndirector danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment , and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other . \nwhile i do not consider myself the \" happy endings are automatically stupid \" type , i thought that \" shallow grave \" really should have ended in tragedy - a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison , in the mental hospital , or in the morgue . \nthis could have been accomplished , quite credibly , but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional \" caper \" ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom , and nothing more . \ngranted , this isn\'t really a \" happy \" ending , but it\'s still pretty light-hearted compared to what preceded it . \ni really shouldn\'t say anything more about the ending as far as details go , but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable . \nyes , this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes , but ultimately it left me feeling as if i\'d been cheated . \nstill , \" shallow grave \" was brilliant most of the way through , and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller , and i am therefore awarding it three stars . \ni guess i just can\'t help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away . \n',pos
'with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up , loading their guns , kissing each other and uttering what sounds like \" rock and roll ! \" \n ( actually , it\'s \" lock and load \" ) , you can\'t help thinking tarantino . \nand of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery , the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie & clyde to natural born killers . \nbut if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction , exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run , normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon . \n \" inspired by true events \" -- we\'ve heard that one before , and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated . . . \nor so strangely poignant . \nfor this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality , who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged . \nbeginning with their final arrest , the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris ( luke perry ) , a policeman , and pam ( ashley judd ) , a factory worker . \nthey fall in love and marry , but pam\'s increasingly erratic behaviour ( going on spending sprees , slashing herself with a knife after an argument ) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris . \nwhen chris gets sacked , they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up . \nthen , chris begins to rob banks . . . \nluke perry accomplishes the not-inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer . \nmoustached , with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation , he is perfectly cast as the long-suffering husband . \n ( it\'s another of john mcnaughton\'s coups of casting-against-type , after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory ) . \nbut it is the character of pam who commands centrestage , and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness , making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person . \nif the performance falls short of greatness , however , it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema , whether it\'s in betty blue , tom & viv or georgia . \nas in those movies , there\'s the danger that the performance seems mannered , a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece . \njudd doesn\'t entirely avoid this pitfall , but pam\'s \'craziness\' is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more \'normal\' chris . \nwhen pam reacts to her father-in-law\'s death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones , chris\' face is the picture of pained restraint . \nof course , it\'s the question of what is \'normal\' that is asked in normal life . \nmcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity . \nit is the rational chris that loves guns ( \" shooting is about precision , control \" ) and the \'crazy\' pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog ( who is then called chaos -- \" chaos and you and me . . . \nwe\'re a real family \" , she notes wryly ) . \nit is chris\' methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber ( his well-planned disguise as a bearded , roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness ) . \nin the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery , a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background : \" buy-more \" -- the perfectly respectable consumption-crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases , and both of them into desperate situations . \nit\'s not a perfect film . \nsome of the dialogue is a touch too banal ( perhaps intentionally ? ) . \nthe use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam\'s crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film . \nindeed , as in mcnaughton\'s seminal film henry : portrait of a serial killer , it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism , the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre , that gives this determinedly unflashy , moving film its great strengths . \nmcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet , coolly \'realistic\' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer . \nthe suburbs , with their miles of white-fenced houses and identikit malls , take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness . \nin its very different way , this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick\'s badlands . \nwhile pam shares the yearnings of malick\'s heroes to escape from ordinary life , chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a \'normal life\' - their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies . \nbut these are dreams defined by , constrained by , and even doomed by , the limitations of the \'normal\' , conventional world . \npam\'s final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs , where wild bushes grow -- symbolically the frontier , the outer limits of her society , but also quite literally the end of the road , where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement . \nthe flying inkpot\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n',pos
'it\'s not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts . \nbut that\'s just what happened to me at uhf , weird al yankovic\'s big screen debut . \nuhf is a television parody a la airplane , and like airplane , the movie is extraordinarily stupid . \nbut it\'s dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb : it\'s so silly and outrageous it\'s hilarious . \nthe movie stars weird al as george newman , a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination , the type who fantasizes he\'s indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns . \ngeorge is basically a loser ; his daydreams and smart-alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks . \nbut george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station . \ngeorge revives channel 62 with innovative programming : shows like \" wheel of fish \" and movies like \" conan , the librarian . \" \nas the station\'s ratings rise , it comes into competition with channel 8 , the leading vhf network-affiliate . \nas r . j . \nfletcher--channel 8\'s ill-natured , hard-nosed owner--veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy ; he really hams it up with his snorts , grimaces , and scowls . \nuhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television , including game shows , tabloid talk shows , children\'s shows , dizzy news women , and movies--everything from rambo to close encounters . \nthe funniest scene , the one that made my head spin , is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed . \nlike most movies in its genre , uhf is hit or miss . \nfor every gag that works , at least one fizzles . \nfor instance , weird al\'s mock video of \" money for nothing \" by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt ( although it does have some nifty computer animation ) . \nbut the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail ; we know another gut wrencher is on the way . \nin fact , uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane-type movie since . . . \nwell , since airplane . \nmuch of the credit goes to weird al\'s exceptionally inventive script and to the movie\'s winsome cast . \nweird al seems a little stiff at the beginning , but because he\'s not afraid to look silly , he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character . \nthe real standout is michael richards as stanley , the dim-witted janitor who becomes the host of his own children\'s show : \" stanley spadowski\'s playhouse . \" \nstanley\'s off-beat , mixed-up personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an over-night star . \nhe is an endearing mixture of good-natured innocence , high-energy enthusiasm , and puppy-dog cuteness . \nand above all , he\'s a good janitor who adores his work . \nanother highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips . \nthe cast also features gedde watanabe ( the chinese foreign-exchange student in sixteen candles ) as the karate master who hosts the hit series , \" wheel of fish . \" \nalso aboard for the ride is fran drescher , who plays pamela finklestein , channel 62\'s roving reporter . \nunfortunately , as weird al\'s girlfriend , victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing but whimpering , whining , and sulking . \nher character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether . \nwhile uhf is not an absolute must-see , it\'s definitely the ticket if you\'re looking for a wild and zany , whacked-out comedy . \nthe movie is good enough to see in the theaters , but it may work even better on television , the very medium at which it pokes fun . \n',pos

'titantic , writer and director james cameron\'s much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? \nas a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful . \nif you\'ve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again . \nthe movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world\'s most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers . \nin either case , it is filmmaking at its best . \nwhen we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long . \nhe said no but that the time would go by so fast she\'d never notice the length . \namazingly , he was right . \ntitanic is one of the few long films that doesn\'t suffer because of it . \nthe lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean . \nfortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world\'s most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as \" the ship of dreams . \" \nthe necklace\'s hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story . \nalthough almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk . \nusing a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing . \nafter twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage . \nin a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast . \nthe strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing . \nentering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane . \nand thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class . \neven with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes . \nin contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board . \nafter jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair . \nnever tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story . \nleonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma . \nin so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part . \nwhen he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal\'s supercilious put-downs . \nkate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose . \nthe chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what\'s eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing . \nfrom the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship\'s bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances . \nif the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year . \npeter lamont\'s sets are more than authentic . \none scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck . \nit then shifts to the ship\'s massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals . \nthe handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner . \neasily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest . \nat first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else . \nwhat a lark . \nwe\'ve struck an iceberg . \nnow let\'s get back to our brandy and cigars . \nthe ship\'s musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in . \nafter all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers . \nwhen the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it . \ntheir civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless . \nthe story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface . \nthere are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on . \nspecial effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable . \nin titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs . \nthe most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water . \npeople are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately . \nbesides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor . \nfrom the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears . \n \" it\'s good-bye for a little while , \" a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first . \n \" this boat\'s for mommies and children . \nthere\'ll be a boat in a little while for daddies . \" \nbasically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats -- it made the decks look too crowded otherwise . \nperhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim\'s on-board the ship . \nin the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink , he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew . \n \" no thanks , \" the elegantly attired guggenheim replies . \n \" we\'re dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen . \nbut we would like a brandy . \" \ntitanic runs 3 : 14 . \nit is rated pg-13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up . \n',pos
' ( warning to those who have not seen seven : this review contains some spoiler information . ) \nseven is a powerful , fully-realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs . \nit is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals--it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled . \nwhile this film is not for the squeamish , there is no denying that seven demands attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance . \nfor starters , classifying seven as a \" thriller \" would not be an altogether complete classification of this film . \nwhile i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an \" intense drama , \" because that is what it delivers--meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up . \npart of director david finchers accomplishment is in style . \nhe seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as \" simple \" as a corpse . \nand visually , fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all-too-realistic and graphic terms ( courtesy of rob bottin\'s always-grisly special effects ) . \nthrow in the appropriate but not-to-be-underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene . \nthese scenes alone are quite impressive ; as fascinating as they are harrowing . \nyet , seven is more than just a technical accomplishment . \nin addition to style , fincher supplies substance . \nseven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand , and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society . \ndetective william somerset ( morgan freeman ) is a man who has nearly given up on the world . \nits easy to see why . \nthe world doesn\'t make sense . \n ( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct . \nafter knocked down and robbed of his wallet , the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes . ) \nwhy should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and \" picking up the pieces \" he will be able to catch the killer ? \nsomersets new partner , david mills ( brad pitt ) has not given up on the world , perhaps because he is still young ( and perhaps by having this optimism he\'s naive in this films portrayal of the world ) . \nhe completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope . \nhowever , david\'s wife ( gwyneth paltrow ) has so much fear of her urban surroundings , she isn\'t even sure if she wants to * tell * her husband about her recent pregnancy , let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment . \nthese three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered . \nand in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world , fincher gives us support for * why * they feel the way they do . \nbut if there\'s one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey , it has to be the killer , john doe ( kevin spacey ) . \nseven\'s payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does . \none important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a \" psycho , \" with no motives behind his slayings . \nthis is exactly the mistake mills makes . \nin the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes , were allowed to see that doe is , in his mind , merely a product of society . \nhe\'s a killer who kills those who are bringing society down . \nin his mind he didn\'t kill \" innocent \" people , and , perhaps , they were not completely innocent ( but , then again , who is ? ) . \nhes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent . \nreally , seven doesn\'t just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed-up john doe is . \nseven makes larger statements about how screwed-up society is , hinting that society\'s degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does . \nbesides the stylistic and larger-issue arguments for seeing this film , i recommend seven because it is , after all , also a very slick and well-made thriller . \nit features exciting plot developments , commanding performances , lots of suspense , and a conclusion that is chilling , riveting , and quite unfair . \nbut then again , its a cruel world . \n',pos
'i was born in 1970 , which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons , 8 tracks and disco . \nhowever , since i was 17 years old i\'ve seen more than my share of adult films . \ni mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i\'m not against pornogrpahy . \ni\'ve seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available . \ndirector paul thomas anderson\'s boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema , the mid to late 70s . \nthis was the period when x-rated movies were real movies , shot on film , shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics . \nthis was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films , films that attempted to tell a real story . \none of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how , like in an any other billion dollar industry , the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete . \nin this case , the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette . \nburt reynold\'s manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur , known as jack horner . \nhorner\'s has a steady \" family \" of performers , some of whom live in his plush l . a . home . \nbut in the world of porn , performers are a commodity - the fresher , the better . \nwhen horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable . \nit is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his . \nas directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door . \nboogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l . a . \'s hardcore film scene . \nbut the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends . \nthe downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut . \nby the film\'s final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams . \nboogie nights is not about sex . \nit does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers . \nin fact , the film isn\'t really about pornography at all . \npornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are . \nthe film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world . \nyet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively . \nthe characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion . \nfirst stop , the den mother ( julianne moore ) in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son . \nsecond stop , the cuckold crewman ( william h . macy ) who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone ( the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real-life porn star nina hartley ) . \nbut the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams . \neddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it . \nwith no real ambition of his own , he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame . \nhis alcoholic mother , clearly dissatisfied with her own lot , abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house . \nhorner introduces him to amber waves ( moore ) who immediately adopts him , a nuclear family is born . \nthe surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her \" babies \" provides some of the films most poignant scenes . \nclearly , she is not even fit to manage her own life , let alone nurture these lost children . \nbut the need to love and be loved is so strong , they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to . \neven the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family . \nthen again , perhaps its not so different from real families at all . \neddie adams , who later takes on the screen name \" dirk diggler \" , is skillfully acted by former pop-star , mark wahlberg . \ni say \" former \" pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job . \nthis is bold and brave territory for such a young man . \nhe pulls it off marvelously . \nwahlberg is a \" big , bright star \" with a big bright future . \nboogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt , without the first amendment preachiness . \nits intimate studies of character make it the superior film . \nwahlberg\'s surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson\'s . \nbut in my opinion , boogie nights , is not the best film of the year . \ni got the feeling that itus 2 1/2 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance . \nstill , if the subject matter of this film intimidates you , thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing , but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway . . . ya \nknow , kinda like disco . \n',pos
'those print and television ads trumpeting that \" \'grease\' is still the word \" are right on the money . \nto celebrate its 20th anniversary , this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like \" star wars \" -- a well-deserved , red-carpet rerelease . \nthat\'s fantastic , especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up -- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie ( didi conn ) being serenaded by her tell-it-like-it-is guardian angel ( frankie avalon ) ? \nor the hard-nosed principal ( eve arden ) reminding the student body to \" be an athletic supporter \" by rooting for the home team ? \nor national bandstand emcee vince fontaine ( edd byrnes ) flirting with marty ( a pre- \" empty nest \" dinah manhoff ) ? \nand these are all probably considered minor moments . . . \na very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newton-john have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson , and their pairing still ranks as one of screendom\'s most effervescently charming . \nfor those eight of you who aren\'t familiar with the story , here\'s a brief recap : greaser bad boy danny and aussie good girl sandy are reunited for their 1959 senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer ; both thought she was going to return to her native continent before school started , but both were wrong . \nsandy tries to rekindle their relationship , but danny\'s too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t-bird buddies ( including jeff conaway ) . \nso sandy hooks up with a gang herself -- the pink ladies , headed by sassy , sexy rizzo ( stockard channing , just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time ) -- and danny , who still really feels love for her , attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back . \nthe drag race finale is yet something of a drag , and i never have thought much of \" greased lightening , \" the film\'s big \" guy \" number ( that choreography -- ack ! ) , but \" grease \" \'s flaws amount too few to carp . \nthe movie\'s first showpiece is \" summer nights , \" where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their fun-in-the-sun romance . \nnot only is \" nights \" tremendously catchy , but it\'s also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes . \nthere has yet to be a live-action musical sequence that rivals the one-two punch of \" you\'re the one that i want \" and \" we go together , \" \" grease \" \'s euphoric cappers . \nall this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller , quieter moments ; the oscar-nominated \" hopelessly devoted to you \" is a lovely showcase for newton-john , and channing\'s lamenting ballad \" there are worse things i could do \" is one of \" grease \" \'s most unjustly overlooked tunes . \nthe soundtrack is remastered ( though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of \" nights \" ) and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan-and-scanned-out choreography , but nothing else has changed -- no computer-generated backgrounds , no outtakes or new musical numbers , no jabba the hutt cameos . \nand it\'s a testament to \" grease \" \'s timeless success that nothing needs to be changed -- it\'s the same all-around blast it\'s always been , with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music . \nto \'90s viewers , \" grease \" will probably recall disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doo-wop and poodle skirts . \nbut regardless of what decade it transports us to , we can all agree on one thing -- without a doubt , \" grease \" is still the word . \n',pos

'in a flashback , the teenage girl in the eccentric family in the canadian film , the hanging garden , tells her senile grandmother that she is going to a school dance . \nhorrified , the grandmother wants to know if her granddaughter knows \" the rule of 6 . \" \nif you don\'t break off a kiss by the count of 6 , then you committed a sin with the boy . \nand most of all , the grandmother wants to know if she has \" protection ? \" \nshe must carry a rosary in her pocket at all times . \nthe richly acted film is written and directed by thom fitzgerald in a quirky but loving style . \nalthough some may refer to the film as yet another dysfunctional family picture , that moniker misses the mark . \nyes , every member of the household has their own special problems , but the writer didn\'t choose to name so many characters for various flowers by accident . \nthis delightful little picture mixes love , tragedy and pathos , resulting in a hopeful and almost magical concoction . \nduring the opening credits we observe the boy , sweet william , at the center of the story . \nfirst , he\'s an average sized young lad who is slapped off-screen by his father . \nnext , he\'s 300 pound teenager , played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte . \nwhen the opening credits end , we cut to 10 years later . \nwilliam is now an average-sized , reasonably happy adult , played with love and compassion by chris leavins . \nwilliam has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his free-spirited and foul-mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover , fletcher ( joe s . keller ) . \nkerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy . \nnicole burnell , who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter , plays the teenage rosemary . \nthe father of the family , whiskey mac ( peter macneill ) , is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful . \nhis wife , iris ( seana mckenna ) , says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids . \nrounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine-year-old violet , the sister whom william meets for the first time . \nas the exuberant irish music fills the air at the wedding in the family home , william wanders off to try on one of his old coats , which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self . \nthe director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways . \nhe takes a common wedding dress train and uses it to set up scenes in fresh and fascinating ways . \nrosmary\'s trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated , and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath , all while talking to her brother . \nas much as anything , the film is a series of character sketches . \nin one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter , a homosexual one . \nalthough he is perfectly happy liking the same sex , his mother is aghast . \na woman friend of hers suggests she take william to a local housewife , dusty miller ( martha irving ) , who , for a fee , will have heterosexual sex with william . \nwith absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch without being sensational . \ndusty , after asking iris to watch her daughter , takes william and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex . \nall of this notwithstanding , he still prefers males . \nthe film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes face-to-face with himself when younger . \nthis causes his ugly old memories to be reignited . \nin the most devastating , he has to come to grips with his former self who was so overwhelmed with the stress that he tried to hang himself . \neven here , the director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker . \nthe ultimate result is an uplifting story that has more hope that one would ever expect from the outline of its plot . \nthe hanging garden runs 1 : 31 . \nit is rated r for strong sexuality , language , violence and some teen drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old and mature . \n',pos
'you\'ve probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi , but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over `keeping the faith\' . \nit\'s a fluffy comedy , thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer , regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head-on . \nas youngsters , brian finn , jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio . \nwhile their friendship progressed , anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support , so neither would feel excluded . \nbut tragedy soon struck , as anna was forced to move away . \nnow adults , brian ( edward norton ) and jacob ( ben stiller ) hold similar but contrastive jobs . \nthe likable and kind-hearted father brian is a catholic priest , while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi . \non the basketball court , they refer to themselves as `the god squad\' . \nin the relationship field , brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy , but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory . \neverything changes when anna ( jenna elfman ) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums . \nnow a workaholic , she devotes endless hours per week to her business , but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob - both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again . \nwith these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail , there\'s bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters . \npredicting the outcome is not entirely difficult , but `keeping the faith\' is open , entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b . \nedward norton has emerged as one of the finest , most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller `primal fear\' . \nafter shockingly bitter roles in `american history x\' and , most recently , david fincher\'s vicious `fight club\' , a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice . \nnot in the least . \nnorton slips into the director\'s chair for the first time with `keeping the faith\' , and here his incisive , resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg . \nweighing every aspect , it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut . \nin addition , norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian , generating a thoroughly likable screen presence . \nstiller ( the zipper guy from `there\'s something about mary\' ) is firm and funny , boasting a fully-ripened comic maturity . \nelfman\'s perky repetition can grow tiresome ( such is occasionally the case on tv\'s `dharma and greg\' ) , but she seems perfectly rambunctious here . \nthe remaining cast members offer fine support , from anne bancroft as jacob\'s animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice . \n`keeping the faith\' is the perfect date flick . . . \nthough perfection is not a word to associate with the film in general . \nthere is turbulence during the process of lift-off , as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead . \nonce the film does settle in , it is often funny and always cheerful . \nstiller , norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities . \nwe enjoy their interaction , understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true . \nthis is excluding the ending , which is acceptable and all , but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements . \nnonetheless , a narrowly mishandled finale certainly won\'t wipe the smile off your face , nor anyone else\'s in the audience . \n`keeping the faith\' is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy , although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion . \naww , what the hell . \nthe quality is not quite heaven-sent , but this little charmer could revive our `faith\' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre . \n',pos

'the \" italian hitchcock \" and acknowledged master of the giallo murder-mystery dario argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena . \nthis time the twist comes in the form of jennifer corvino ( jennifer connelly ) , a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects . \nsent to a girls boarding school in switzerland , she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the school\'s population terrified . \na chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist ( donald pleasance ) leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift . \nphenomena is an imaginative , original thriller . \nwriter/director argento creates several sequences of surreal , haunting beauty here , including a masterfully shot sleepwalking episode and a striking scene when a swarm of flying insects descends on the school at jennifer\'s beckoning . \nthe plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killer\'s identity is genuinely shocking and surprising . \nthe director took a big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden , ex-rolling stone bill wyman , and argento\'s favourite gothic/electronic outfit goblin . \nbut it gels surprisingly well . \nthe film\'s opening music reccurs several times , an eerie and evocative score that perfectly sets the overall tone . \nargento fans beware : the film was released outside europe in a terribly butchered form re-titled as creepers . \nthis deleted nearly half an hour of footage , mainly of key dialogue scenes . \n',pos
'ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances . \nfor his followup to the academy-beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women ) . \ndespite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences . \nthe film opens in the mid-1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england . \nas the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback . \nmeanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest . \nlucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology . \nlucinda is rich ; oscar is poor . \nlucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself . \nyet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it\'s on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin . \nand fate has decreed that they will one day meet . \nthat day doesn\'t occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help . \nanother of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory . \nat first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn\'t take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other . \na friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent . \nbut oscar is uncertain of lucinda\'s affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her . \noscar and lucinda isn\'t beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions . \non more than one occasion , it\'s apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route . \ncoincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can\'t go anywhere . \nthe voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments . \n ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . ) \nyet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda . \nstoryline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters . \nthematically , the film is also strong . \nthe unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated . \noscar and lucinda don\'t just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls . \na card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional \" strip poker \" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion . \noscar does not see gambling as a vice . \nin fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one\'s immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith . \nralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar . \nthe actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen . \nas good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett . \nthe actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford\'s paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda . \nshe gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles . \neffective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen\'s persuasion ) as lucinda\'s close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar\'s mentor , and clive russell as a self-serving adventurer . \nthere\'s a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence . \n ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . ) \nwith the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package . \nthe characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett . \nso who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ? \noscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer . \n',pos
'dark city is such a rare treat : it ? s a stunning , hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir , science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london . \nto boot , it is accompanied by an intense , well written and thoughtful story . \nmovies of this caliber and idea aren ? t made too often , and it ? s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it . \nalex proyas , who ? s previous film the crow looked good but couldn ? t cover up the terrible acting or story , here shows a near masterpiece ; a combination of metropolis , edward hopper and phillip marlowe , fused seemlessly . \nat times it moves beyond film into artwork . \nit is the story of ? strangers ? , aliens from another planet ( and we know they ? re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats ? one of the detractions of the film ) who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live , what makes up our ? soul ? . \nthese aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the ? ultimate technology ? of shaping matter with their mind , called ? tuning . \nthey are aided by a human scientist , played by kiefer sutherland , who has ? betrayed his kind ? and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight . \nduring this time , john murdoch , played swiftly by rufus sewell , wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light ( a terrific visual effect - not only is murdoch confused , but so is the audience ) . \nwithout a memory and a strange guilt that he may be a killer , he receives a phone call to flee , as the strangers are after him . \ni don ? t want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story ; one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop , in a way regaining murdoch ? s ? identity ? along with him . \nit ? s a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography . \nmurdoch ? s wife , anna , is introduced through a stunning beam of light : she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight . \nshadows , outlines of men in hats watch , as she gently curves through the shine . \nwe see the outline of her body from behind , an hourglass , as she sings a slow , rhythmic song . \na great entrance . \nhowever , a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied . \nthe city is nice to look at , but if it ? s a poor story then it ? s not worth watching . \nblade runner was popular not only because it ? s visuals , but it ? s story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience . \nit is discussed it and argued , therefore a success . \nother science fiction films of recent times , such as the fifth element , are nice to look at , but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy . \nwe ? re left with ? love conquers all ? after finishing the fifth element . \ndark city is not so easily explained away . \nas the strangers discovered , locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task . \nwhere is reality ? \ndark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the 90 ? s , and ranks along with the best made in the 80s , such as blade runner and the two aliens films . \nperhaps it ? s the best of the both decades ; it had the darkness of the aliens films , as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner , but moved beyond , i think , because the themes behind it were much stronger . \nanyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write , i ? d love to hear it . \n',pos
'when andy leaves for cowboy camp , his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys . \none of these toys is wheezy , a penguin with a broken squeaker . \nwoody ( tom hanks ) saddles up andy\'s dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy . \nwoody succeeds in his mission , but doesn\'t make it back to the house before al , the unscrupulous owner of al\'s toy barn , recognizes woody as a rare collector\'s item and steals him . \nbuzz lightyear ( tim allen ) leads hamm ( john ratzenberger ) , mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , slinky dog ( jim varney ) , and rex ( wallace shawn ) into the city to find their friend . \nmeanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped . \nal has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950\'s tv puppet show \" woody\'s round-up \" except for a woody doll . \nnow that the collection is complete , al plans to sell woody and his round-up gang-bullseye the horse , jessie the cowgirl ( joan cusack ) , and stinky pete the old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) -to a toy museum in japan . \nthe gang is happy about the move ;

i\'d wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original . \nmost of the vocal performances are first-rate . \ntom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work . \nhowever , one voice-over also stands out as horribly miscast . \nkelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector . \nalthough he does a lot of voice-over work in commercials and on \" the simpsons \" ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice . \nhe doesn\'t have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete . \nthe animation is even better than in the first . \nespecially impressive were the textures of the figures . \nwe can now see the difference between flesh and plastic ; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys , but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint . \nwe can also see that bo peep is porcelain . \nas you can tell from the long-winded phrasing common in the merchandising -- \" disney and pixar\'s \'toy story 2\' \" -- this is pixar\'s coming out party . \nto celebrate they appended their first project , a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball , to the beginning of the movie . \nthey made the short in 1986 , which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then . \non the downside , \" toy story 2 \" follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale , and some sections tend to drag . \noverall , though , i had a great time and found \" story 2 \" to be a worthy successor to the first \" toy story . \" \nbottom line : this one really is fun for the whole family ! \n',pos

hospitality suite . \nthe three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life . \nthe outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why . \nwhat comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living . \nthese are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch . \ntheir dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical . \nfollowing in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high . \nin this case , it is landing the big kahuna . \nthey each are trying to see why he\'s on top and why they are chasing after him . \nwhat makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product . \nand how after each one\'s psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each . \nthe goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna , but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen . \nlarry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life . \nbob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ . \nhis vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in . \nbob is a baptist , who takes a very non-questioning and literal attitude about religion . \nto just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin , according to the way he reads the bible . \nwhen asked by larry why he married his wife , he seems puzzled and can\'t even say because he loves her , only that marriage is something sacred to him . \nthe contrast in their personalities is stark . \nlarry is all business , he simply wants to close the sale . \nhe comes into the room pumped for the convention , using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman . \nhe criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out . \nhe tells him to go on a vacation . \nget a woman . \nwhile phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change , now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife , after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long . \nhe now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in . \nhe has always been a charmer , shaking everyone\'s hand , trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale . \nlarry is more aggressive as a salesman , he is always a heart attack away from every big sale . \nin contrast , bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him . \nthis is his first time for him on the road . \nwhen dick fuller doesn\'t arrive at the party the salesmen throw , larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering . \nwhen told that he spoke to the secretary , larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account . \nbut when they start talking to bob , whom they forced to act as the bartender , they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man\'s name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus . \nbob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards , and that he invited bob to attend . \nlarry and phil can\'t fathom how bob didn\'t make a sales pitch . \nbut they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller\'s attention about their company\'s product as they sent him off to meet fuller , and will await his return in the hotel room . \nthese two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass . \nthe irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room , as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives . \nthese three performers were outstanding , each understanding what their role called for , each coming through with a marvelous performance . \nthe only problem with the film , is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience . \nbut the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see .

'there must be some unwritten rule that states , one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom , even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere . \nin the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year\'s stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech . \nat least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers . \nshe has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn\'t seem like it\'s much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . \ndrugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the \'good life\' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there . \nbut this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . \nin this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . \neven the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from . \nthe film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud\'s grand-daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister . \nit is written by the director\'s brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . \nthe title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . \nwith julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) . \nhe becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls . \nthe girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don\'t know what to make of the relationship . \nit especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother\'s loose attitude and wants to go home . \nthings go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village . \nit seems only that bilal\'s charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there . \nthis scene didn\'t make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . \nbut i doubt that . \nthe family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel . \nlucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a \'normal\' girl . \nthe beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . \nkate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose . \nthe background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . \nthe only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves . \nthe family\'s travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her . \nthat marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts . \nit will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence . \nhe is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him . \nthe new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn\'t comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god . \nthe film\'s weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . \nthe storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by . \nher knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best . \nshe perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn\'t have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . \nafter all , the mystical trip is the journey . \nthe film\'s strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . \nbilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . \nthe little girls are precocious but they are lovable . \njulia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn\'t know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . \nshe was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she\'s at . \nthis is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . \nand , after all is said and done , who\'s to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was ! \n',pos
'driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small , intimate story . \nit\'s a quiet film , a slow film , a deliberate film . \nbut if you\'re patient with it , the movie offers innumerable rewards , such as a pair of self-assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy . \ndriving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry\'s pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name , which first opened in new york four years ago . \nthe play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago , los angeles , london , vienna , norway , and the soviet union . \nuhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza . \nthe film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur . \nthe movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action . \nin fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn\'t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together . \nrather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on . \nthe film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta\'s history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city\'s oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr . \nthe story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway . \nthe insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur . \nfreeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke . \nthe film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger . \ndriving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it\'s about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon . \ndaisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur . \ninitially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere . \nonce she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver . \nto make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand . \neventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke\'s good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him . \ntandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace . \nwe\'ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon . \nnevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own . \nfreeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances . \nthere is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color . \nhoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior . \nboth freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma . \nthey flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves . \nthey bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie\'s gentle humor . \nat the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama . \nin his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy\'s loving and patient son . \ndrama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien ) . \nthe only other significant characters in the film are daisy\'s housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( \" good times \" ) , and boolie\'s pretentious wife , played by patti lupone . \nunder the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again . \nbut fortunately , beresford never forgets he\'s shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes . \nin adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety . \nuhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say . \nberesford wisely exercises restraint in the film\'s dramatic moments . \nthe movie tugs at your heart , but it never goes for the jugular . \nthe only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees . \n',pos
'in may of 1977 , just 2 years after steven spielberg\'s success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas\' the godfather , a risky , ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success . \nlittle did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film . \nin january of this year , lucas re-released star wars on its 20th anniversary . \nin this new , remastered version , the added effects , which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer-generated jabba the hutt , don\'t do much but call attention to themselves . \nother than these , the film is exactly the same . \nwhy pay to see it in the theaters , you might ask ? \nsimply because when this movie was released , most of us were a few years short of being born . \nwe should all get up and go to the movies for the experience , especially if you haven\'t seen it . \nthe plot is basic but in the same way , complex . \nit has many themes , but the one rotates around luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) and his quest to become a jedi knight . \nhis mission begins when a droid named r2-d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , which tells him to contact the mysterious obi-wan kanoby ( alec guiness ) . \nhe and kanoby then , joined by two inter-galactic renegades , hans solo ( harrison ford ) and chewbacca , and skywalker\'s two droids d2 and c3po ( the voice of anthony edwards ) , wage war upon the corrupt empire , commanded by an evil general ( peter cushing ) and the traitorous darth vader ( the voice of james earl jones ) . \nskywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger : the force . \nthe film is obviously quite star-studded . \nbut how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones\' voice would appear so many more times in the future ? \nit just happened to work out for him . \nthe magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker\'s triumph is symbolized by the audience\'s sense of becoming something larger than life itself-a universe of fans , young and old , recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever . \n , \n',pos
'seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . \nwhen it comes to modern gangster movies , it\'s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word \" routine . \" \ni\'ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it\'s been used before ) can provide for a good story and \" donnie brasco \" clinches this idea . \nit\'s not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another\'s style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . \nthe film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . \nwe meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . \nhe and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . \nsomehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn\'t afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . \nit\'s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . \ni have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . \nhowever , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . \nthe first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . \nthe screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . \nmost gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . \nthankfully the film doesn\'t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . \nmuch of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . \npacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . \nhe\'s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . \nwe learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it\'s easy to sympathize with him . \nnewell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . \nas donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it\'s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . \nmost of the film tells the story of donnie\'s life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn\'t always seem to come together as a whole . \nthe storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . \nthe resonance to donnie\'s actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn\'t always seem to have much meaning . \nback home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he\'s never a and the family is suffering . \nsince this is based on a true story i wouldn\'t doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . \nmy only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . \na climax of sorts does occur , but there\'s little feeling of a payoff . \nwe get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . \naside from a few minor , general flaws , \" donnie brasco \" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . \nit may be routine , but it\'s good , and that\'s respectful . \n',pos
'in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she\'ll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they\'ll most enjoy . \nsome scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before . \nthis can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat\'s true colors begin to shine through . \nmaking a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom\'s chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year . \nwhat gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom\'s 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what\'s on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences . \nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness . \nchocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . \nthe bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . \nmany are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne\'s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business . \non the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne\'s shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . \nalso a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . \njuliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character\'s determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat\'s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses . \nlena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs . \njudi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin . \ncarrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously . \nvictoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down . \na trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : \" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . \" \nthat\'s not to say the men don\'t do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o\'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne . \nthe technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film . \ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman\'s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules . \nchocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter . \nwhile not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom\'s chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale . \nand it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the

'meet joe black is your classic boy-meets-girl , boy-likes-girl , boy-gets-killed-in-horrible-accident , supernatural-entity-takes-over-boy\'s-body , supernatural-entity-falls-in-love-with-girl story . \nbased on the 1934 film death takes a holiday , meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama which explores the meanings of life and love . \nwilliam parrish ( anthony hopkins ) is a billionaire businessman on the brink of his 65th birthday . \nhe has built a huge media empire , and raised two beautiful daughters , allison ( marcia gay harden ) and susan ( claire forlani ) . \nwilliam has been able to negotiate his way out of many tough spots . . . but he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality , the one situation he won\'t be able to talk his way out of . \nand he has good reason to fear , for death himself is stalking him . \nhowever , death has a deal to make . \ndeath has taken possession of a man who has recently died ( brad pitt ) , and wants william to be his guide in a holiday among the living . \nin return , william gets to live a few extra days . \nof course , he agrees . \ndeath , under the human name of \" joe black \" , gets to experience life as a complete innocent . \nhe never before has experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut butter . \nand he\'s not quite compared for the more complex pleasures when he and susan fall in love . \nbut , is their affair doomed to an early demise ? \nat nearly three hours in length , meet joe black is a little bit on the leisurely side , though it never gets boringly lengthy . \ninstead , the film gets a chance to develop some nicely textured characters and situations . \nyou get to soak in and enjoy the atmosphere , rather than being hurriedly rushed through it . \nthe romantic angle works well , though , surprisingly , the interactions between joe black and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter . \nthis is most likely due to anthony hopkins , who once again displays his superb acting skills . \nwilliam is a desperate man who has had a seemingly ideal life , and doesn\'t want to let it go . \nby contrast , claire forlani is merely the romantic interest . \nshe gets to show joe the ropes of love , but is hardly as interesting a character . \nas joe black , brad pitt seems a bit stilted . \ngranted , he\'s supposed to be out-of-place , but the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract from the role . \nstill , he is able to hold his own , and over the course of the three hours , his character begins to grow on you . \nthe main character who seems out of place here is drew ( jake weber ) , an ambitious executive in williams\' company who is joe black\'s main rival for susan\'s affections . \nweber plays the character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash . \nthis cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimensional characters . \nthe supernatural elements of the film are handled murkily , but never distractingly so . \nwe never learn what is the exact nature of death , or why he\'s never done something like this before . \nit actually gets a bit creepy when death talks to the dying in their own voices/accents . \n ( his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter . . . ) \nand the ultimate resolution to one of the film\'s supernatural problems seems , well , somewhat superficial . \nstill , even with the film\'s length , it was a pleasant time at the movies , something you wouldn\'t necessarily expect from a film about death . . . but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow . \n',pos
'being the self-proclaimed professional film critic that i am , i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia ( coming soon to dvd ) until only recently . \nafter all , it\'s considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean , who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai , and doctor zhivago . \nso one day , a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it . \ni was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt-numbing 3 1/2 hours of its duration . \nbut now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against -- the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture , director , editing , cinematography , art direction , music , and sound . \nafter watching the film again , i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen . \nbased on the autobiographical writing of british officer t . e . \nlawrence during world war i , lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence ( played by then-unknown actor peter o\'toole ) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever . \nbored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building , lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re-assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army . \nlawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i . \nshot in panavision\'s famed super 70mm format , the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic . \nit is absolutely breathtaking . \nusing stunning cinematography , costuming , and direction , shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth , i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes . \nevery shot is choreographed as a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land . \ndavid lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time , a far cry from its pathetic , uncreative existence today . \nafter watching the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , \" i\'ve got to do a remake of this film ! \" \nbut then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern-day movie executive : \" okay , it\'s going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert . \nwe are going to need to blow up a full-size train because computer-generated effects probably wont do it justice . \nand we are not going to use any big stars , and won\'t have any female actors since there\'s no love story . \" \nyes , my friends , the velvet curtain fell on the golden-era of hollywood a long time ago . \nbut at least we still have the proof to show all would-be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be . \n',pos
'my summer was recently saved by two very different movies . \non opening night , i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron . \nthen a few nights later , i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman\'s greenfingers even though it didn\'t feature a trip to band camp , girl-on-girl action , or seann william scott . \nhowever , i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers , which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs ( clive owen of croupier ) . \nafter spending roughly half of his life behind bars , he is transferred to a more lenient facility , edgefield . \nthe picaresque , rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade , while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges . \nat first , briggs doesn\'t want to be there . \nhe\'s used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone . \nhowever , his ailing roommate , fergus ( david kelly of waking ned devine ) , wears briggs down through his benign nature . \nthe two become friends , with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift . \nbriggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil , and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers . \nafter the prison\'s governor ( warren clarke ) reprimands them , he\'s awed at what briggs has accomplished . \nand he\'s struck by an idea -- briggs , fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prison\'s grounds . \ngreenfingers , which is \" inspired by actual events , \" becomes a bit like a sports movie after that . \ndespite their differences , the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game -- in this case a prestigious garden show . \none renegade , in this case , briggs , will prove to have talent . \nof course , love will also rear its head ( no , not \" prison love \" ) . \nto hershman\'s credit , he doesn\'t pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs , like last year\'s lame marijuana comedy saving grace . \ni had to keep pinching myself when i didn\'t see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies , or the men giving high-fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers . \nthe movie deals with people and scores on that concept . \nit\'s wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again . \ngive credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting . \nhis speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freeman\'s last stand in the shawshank redemption . \nowen\'s bedside scenes with kelly , who lends the film a human touch , are a marvel to behold , emotionally gripping without being sappy . \nwritten by hershman , greenfingers contains plenty of laughs . \nmost come courtesy of helen mirren , who shines as the world-class gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose ( natasha little ) when she starts dating briggs . \nthe mother can\'t believe what he\'ll do if her daughter \" burns the sunday roast . \" \nnothing is forced in greenfingers . \nthe funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines . \nprimrose and briggs\' relationship takes awkward steps . \neven when briggs decides to go back to edgefield , it\'s done for reasons of loyalty , not because the movie requires him to do so . \nafter grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like america\'s sweethearts and the princess dairies , it\'s an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well . \n',pos
'every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise . \ni don\'t necessarily mean in terms of quality ; rather , i\'m referring to the mere knowledge of its existence . \nusually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo . \nit has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly . \nthat\'s a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing . \nwhat\'s more , it\'s surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history . \nprincess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside . \napparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good-hearted gentlewoman mrs . worrall ( wendy hughes ) . \nher banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none-too-pleased about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo . \nthis development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr . worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs . worrall . \nhowever , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be , and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo . \nas a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner . \nit takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing . \nbut it is handled most effectively through the character of mr . worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude . \nhe is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them , and since the house and money are all from mrs . worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort . \nwhile hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co-writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light-hearted to be heavy-handed . \nhe also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes , as the princess becomes a \" sensation \" at court . \nin one of the film\'s best sequences , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent ( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions ) , and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance . \nit is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in \" sensations , \" an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) . \nsocial commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment . \nthe performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime . \nher supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs . worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls\' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weary but ultimately romantic gutch . \nonly john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess\'s identity . \nthe story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky . \nit is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn\'t given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there . \nwhen it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible . \nprincess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp . \nstill , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out . \nit is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding--a hidden gem . \n',pos
'city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental . \ni find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality . \ncity of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years . \nit\'s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we\'re so used to seeing in films like this . \ncity of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders\' 1988 film wings of desire . \ni have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two . \ni have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn\'t a rip-off of its source material . \nnicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it ) . \none day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr . maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her . \nthe angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can\'t experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch ) . \nhe shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status . \nseth wants to become human so he can feel her . \nthat\'s when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , \" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race . \" \n ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . ) \nmessinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human . \nseth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel . \nthis , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it\'s like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead . \nsince i love this film so much , i\'ll make a minor note that it certainly isn\'t perfect . \nalthough it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre . \nthe plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent , and steel has done a great job with them ) . \nthe ending , too , could have been more powerful and less predictable . \nthese elements are minor , though , and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels . \nthe acting is superb from everyone involved . \nthis is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock ) . \nhe\'s quiet and pensive , and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words . \nhe\'s perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassures us he\'s not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he shows in face/off ) . \nmeg ryan is a powerful , enticing , and appealingly-chirpy actress , and her work here is some of her best . \ndennis franz , however , steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel . \nwhat i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation . \ndirector brad silberling is a talented man , and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters , rather than forced sentimentality . \nhis direction is steady , and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning , maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead . \nthere is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information . \nthis is the way stories should be told , and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real . \nthe film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do . \ncinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i\'ve seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) . \nthe music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it\'s quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . \nthe visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . \nall of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . \nit\'s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously . \n',pos
'in roger michell\'s romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it\'s name to the film\'s title . \none day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey . \nquickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat . \nthe film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna\'s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress\'s appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such . \nwithout words , this sequence gives us a background to her character . \nfollowing , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives . \ni don\'t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn\'t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie\'s beginning , but there it is . \nif there were ever a clear case for \" less is more , \" this would be it . \nthe film is told nearly first person from william\'s point of view , as he is in every scene . \nby nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . \nin fact , much of notting hill\'s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . \na scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he\'s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator . \nor take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . \nwilliam assures her he wouldn\'t say a word , then adds , \" well , i\'ll probably tell myself now and then , but i\'d never believe it . \" \ngreat stuff . \nthe downside to spending so much time with william is that we don\'t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . \nwe\'re constantly exposed to william\'s thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don\'t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . \nthere are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we\'re not sure what she\'s been thinking all the times in between . \nthis , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant\'s film hands down . \nhe gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance . \njulia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress\'s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character\'s unpredictable behavior . \nanna doesn\'t get a lot of our compassion . \nthis romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast . \nmost notable is rhys ifans as spike , william\'s eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh . \nhugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william\'s friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister\'s birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . \nit\'s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . \nroger michell\'s use of visuals doesn\'t sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . \nfor example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . \nwhereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying \" eight months later , \" michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william\'s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him . \nanother memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air . \nwe\'re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird\'s eye view of the ground below . \nmusic is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film\'s scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . \nit\'s kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today\'s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . \nat least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . \nnotting hill\'s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . \nfor a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that\'s not so bad , now is it ? \n',pos
'usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock . \nothers will mention meg ryan . \nbut for me , it\'s not even close . \njaneane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy , she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now . \nand it\'s a good thing she\'s starring in the matchmaker , because without her presence the movie would be bland , unfunny , and dull . \ngarofalo stars as marcy tizard , a top aide to boston senator john mcglory , who is suffering in the polls . \nin an attempt to capture the irish vote , he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory\'s that never moved to america . \nunfortunately for marcy , her visit coincides with the town\'s annual matchmaking festival . \nthings get off to a rocky start for marcy though . \nshe has no hotel reservations ( for no rational reason ) and the tiny confined room ( tired old cliche\' ) she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub . \nhis name is sean , and marcy finds him repugnant at first , so you can obviously tell where this is headed . \nthe movie runs into a few roadblocks . \nfor instance , the story is very thin . \nnone of the characters ( except the old local matchmaker ) are nearly as interesting as garofalo . \nsome of the characters , like the political aide played by denis leary , have wandered in from a completely different movie . \ni think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery , and several close-ups of garofalo\'s winning smile . \nthe strange thing is that it works . \ngarofalo\'s charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories , and it carries this one . \n',pos
' \" i know what you did last summer , \" the first high-profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996\'s \" scream , \" and written by the same screenwriter , kevin williamson , is a stylish , effective horror film that became 1997\'s biggest hit of the fall season . \nwhile \" scream \" was a more knowing film about the genre , \" i know what you did last summer \" is more reminiscent of a straight-forward slasher flick , but it is far more intelligent than such bottom-of-the-barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the \" friday the 13th \" films ( well , okay , \" jason goes to hell \" was pure hell to sit through ) . \nthe film starts off with four talented , aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport , n . c . \nit is the 4th of july , and they will soon be heading their separate ways . \nkind-hearted julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , and outsider ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) will be headed off to college , while helen ( sarah michelle gellar ) , who has just been honored croaker queen in the town , and her ignorant jock boyfriend , barry ( ryan phillippe ) , are going to new york to become an actress and football player . \nwhen the four of them travel to a nearby mountain-side beach for the evening , they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home . \ndistraught and confused , they decide they can\'t go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter , so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean , in hopes no one will find him . \njulie is apprehensive about it , but is forced into it by barry . \nswitch to exactly a year later , julie , still unable to come to terms with what she did , reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out . \nalmost immediately , julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads , \" i know what you did last summer , \" and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook . \n \" i know what you did last summer , \" is a successful horror film for a number of reasons . \nthe cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian , as it put shadows , fog , steam , and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings . \nthe characters , particularly julie and helen , are realistically written , and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes , which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort . \nand last , the film creates a few dazzling and scary set-pieces that are some of the most memorable i\'ve seen in a horror movie , particularly the suspenseful , superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family\'s store with the killer inside with her . \nperhaps the best character is that of missy egan ( anne heche ) , a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit . \nheche\'s performance is a standout , as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time . \n \" i know what you did last summer , \" could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems . \nprinze jr . gives a performance to be desired here , and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth . \nalso , the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer , who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines . \nluckily , the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale , which includes an expertly crafted \" jump-in-your-seat \" scare . \nin the main roles , hewitt and gellar are highly talented , and hewitt , especially , is one of the best screamers i\'ve ever heard . \nshe honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best \" scream queen . \" \nand gellar is touching as a young woman who , in the course of one year , finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered . \nalthough not up to the level of either \" scream \" movies , or the more recent , \" urban legend , \" \" i know what you did last summer \" is a respectable , smartly-scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made . \n',pos
'when jim henson passed away , he left behind diverse legions of fans and a company whose ultimate success , it now seems , hinged on his input . \njim henson productions and the creature shop are still thriving financially , but as the last two muppet films ( or that silly computer-generated monkey from lost in space ) demonstrate , the thrill and genius are gone . \ni\'m not sure the dark crystal , made today , would generate from an audience of kids five to fifty the same awe-filled response . \nan all-powerful crystal has cracked , causing the leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings : the big , gentle mystics , and the vulture-like skeksis . \nthe mystics send jen , a naive gelfling boy , on a mission to find the shard that cracked away , which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers , before the great \" conjunction \" of three suns . \nalong the way , jen encounters and teams up with the only other gelfling alive , the rebecca demornay-like kira , an ogre-witch named aughra , who removes her eyes to look at things , and a spastic-but-friendly , tumbleweed-like animal named fizzgig . \nmuch of the beauty in the dark crystal , which is a simple tale ( though it does not condescend to any viewer ) , lies in its art direction and creature design . \nthe puppeteering is phenomenal--observe the scenes in which jen plays his flute , or the landwalker chase--but i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture , a delicately-narrated ( by john baddeley ) , absorbing prologue . \nthe voice work in the film , by muppet regulars and irregulars , is tone-perfect . \nas well , trevor jones\' score should not be discounted : it contributes to the film almost as an unseen character . \ni suppose , due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature , that it couldn\'t be helped , but i wish the film was longer . \njen and kira have wonderful . . . well , \nchemistry , and more scenes of them quietly conversing would have been appreciated . \nthe dark crystal has a very small cult following . \nthe weaker labyrinth is probably better-known , which is upsetting . \na friend of mine related a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinth\'s creatures due to the financial failure of people-less the dark crystal . \nthat film never quite found its footing ; it played like an acid-trip episode of \" the muppet show \" with david bowie as guest-host , borrowing from tolkien and pandering to tolkien\'s fan-base . \n ( i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of the public . ) \nthe dark crystal deserved ( and still deserves ) a bigger audience . \nit\'s the best kind of children\'s entertainment : elegant , fantastical , and courageously un-hip . \nbrian henson , fortunate son , keep looking back at this , your father\'s masterpiece . \n',pos
'so here is the second of 1999\'s remakes of classic horror movies . \nthe first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic \'the haunting\' . \nnow comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill . \nthe classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 , 000 to stay in his house . \nif they survive the night they get the money . \nif not well you get the jurisdiction . \nhaving not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn\'t sure if i would really like the remake . \nbut sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on . \ngeoffrey rush ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people . \nhis wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends . \nsteven dismays at the idea and makes his own list . \nsomehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party . \neddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assistant who can re-wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk-show host in sorts , dr . blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouthed humorist in ways . \nwhat he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night . \nif they can they get the money , if not well they don\'t . \nthe house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum . \nyears before mental patients broke out and killed the dr . there , forcing him to lock the place up because if he died , so did they . \neveryone who was in there burned to death . \nnow it is steven price\'s home and he is throwing this party for these five people . \nwhat starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night . \nthe deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed . \none-by-one the people start to disappear . \nconspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all . \nthe people find rooms , which once held mental patients . \nrooms which once had people dying . \nrooms which may still contain these people . \nnow these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results . \nsince i officially haven\'t seen the original i can\'t say which is better . \ni can say however i liked this movie . \ngeoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price , and does a great job doing a vincent price role . \nfamke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times . \nali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs . \nchris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines . \npeter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims . \nthe plot was well conceived and was very absorbing . \nthe movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy , and even sometimes downright scary . \ni found even the opening credits to me a little ominous . \none thing i knew not to expect was a \'haunting\' type movie with special effects galore . \neven though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn\'s show all the way through but you can tell . \nthe movie was written well , and it\'s only major flaw is the under-developed characters and plot holes that we are left with . \nthe ending is quite clever and some may not even get it . \ni must say house on haunted hill was a surprise . \ni was expecting another haunting with special effects , no scares and a dumb ending . \ninstead i found a good halloween movie with gore , scares and great acting . \nhouse on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can\'t take seriously . \nthough it is a well-made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws . \nbut besides that the movie is fun , smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can\'t be made all the time ! \n',pos
'apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) . \ndirector ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . \nbeing the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet . \nperhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . \nall of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . \napollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . \njim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . \nsuspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . \nif they ever reach it . \ned harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly . \naudiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . \nalso , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . \nthe special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner . \nwatch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . \na bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . \nthose who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate\' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . \nthis is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . \nyou should enjoy it . \n',pos
'perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects . \nthere is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise . \nwhereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology . \nthe latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers\' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie\'s story . \nunlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event . \nit runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film\'s length . \ncontrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound . \nin this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp . \nwith its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented . \nthe script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach . \nbut , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent . \nthe viewers don\'t care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner . \nand right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story . \nas the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind . \nbillions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- \" farms \" our life energy . \nonly a select group of individuals knows of the \" real \" world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . \nmorpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth . \nthe cast plays out this story in stylish fashion . \nthe set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy . \nthe costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles . \nfor instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of \" agents \" created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather . \nthe casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn\'t required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool . \nsupports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual . \none of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year\'s science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would\'ve worked from a different approach . \nthe alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise . \nthe better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun . \n',pos
'let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies . \ni adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998\'s one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven . \nwas it any good ? \nwell , just about as good as baldwin\'s steven seagal impression ( for those i\'ve confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) . \nnow let me clarify , i don\'t love just any cop movie ; i\'m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80\'s and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker . \ni\'m partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection . \nproblem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a \" true \" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail . \nso what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? \ntruth is i\'m a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches . \nyes it\'s all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i\'m guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from . \nas little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe\'s , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos . \nas an adult my tastes haven\'t changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a \" guy \" film could potentially bring . \nnow what if it\'s the cops who\'re the corrupt ones ? \nooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain . \nthrow a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) \ninto the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city . \nhow absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ? \nso damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved . \nthe film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at . \nsince i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn\'t . \n ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) . \nlike mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn\'t make it to where he should have . \n ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) . \nhere , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino\'s in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) . \nwilliams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york . \nthey work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes . \nand that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done . \nthe squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice . \ndanny has done this , and though he\'s a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way . \nhe seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a \" double agent \" . \nhe does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners . \nright away we know that that is exactly what he\'ll have to do . \nand watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be . \nundercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) . \nhow can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ? \nprince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat . \nlumet\'s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action . \nhis scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking . \nlumet\'s worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension . \nthis isn\'t as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet\'s most recent cop \\ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching . \nthough of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot . \nsome of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic . \nhollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable . \nof course cop movies aren\'t popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn\'t gay , the lame comic relief character who\'s never funny , and on and on . \nfor all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \\ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills . \nit focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies . \nthere\'s a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he\'s about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing . \nthis is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak . \nin the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out . \nhe\'s lost his voice . \ndoes that little itty bitty detail matter ? \nmaybe not to most , but it sure made my night . \nand in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it\'s nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things . \n',pos

'bill condon\'s \" gods and monsters \" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics \" frankenstein \" and \" bride of frankenstein . \" \nsince i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale\'s inner fantasies and hallucinations . \nwhale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him . \nas the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home . \njames whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , \" a dirty old man . \" \nin one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale\'s home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing . \nbecause of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off . \nclayon agrees , and doesn\'t really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past . \ncertainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . \n \" gods and monsters \" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a \" motion picture director , \" rather than a \" horror director . \" \nand in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore . \nit is evident that whale\'s first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life . \nas played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself . \nhe never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . \nthrough the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life . \nalthough boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people\'s homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him . \nsince whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . \nalthough an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness . \nit is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the \" on-again-off-again \" friendship at the film\'s center is fairly predictable . \nwe know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds . \nin lesser hands , this set-up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . \nalso , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . \nif the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether . \n \" gods and monsters \" is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone . \nthe film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end . \nwalking away from \" gods and monsters , \" it was ian mckellen\'s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . \nit is a sad testament when a person\'s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else\'s business in the first place . \n',pos
'before you read my review , you gotta know that i love woody allen . \nthis is a very important note because allen\'s films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone . \ni know folks who believe him to be a complete genius , while others see him as a dirty ol\' schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again . \ni love most of his films , but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s . \nin fact , why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me ! \nif you look at the quality of those films , you\'ll hear what i\'m saying . \nthe only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives . \nin fact , i secretly hoped that he would take some \" time off \" at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energize or something , but it doesn\'t appear as though he has any intention of doing that . \nso here i am again , reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old . \nplot : the year is 1940 and woody allen is a top-notch insurance investigator . \nhis methods are very old-fashioned and apparently out of date . \na new employee ( hunt ) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency . \nthe two do not like each other . \none night , they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician , and unbeknownst to them , placed under his control . \nsoon thereafter , jewels are stolen , words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer . \ncritique : a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies , with the fast-talking witty banter between co-workers , a catchy jazz score moving things along , film noirish elements such as the veronica lake-type sexpot , one-liners galore and a fluffy , if inconsequential plotline . \non the downside , the film actually starts off pretty slowly , with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there , but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy . \nthe sets , on the other hand , were amazing , the production design and costumes were perfect , and the casting ideal , so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man . \nbut it wasn\'t not long before i was fully engaged by the characters , entertained by the many zingers delivered back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actually interested in the resolution of the flick . \ni also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron\'s entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool ) . \nof course , films like this ( with little or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue , and once again , allen does a great job in playing his character , who for once , isn\'t his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude . \nhe actually plays a \" macho \" guy here and handles it pretty well , especially the scenes in which he\'s hypnotized . \nbut the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt , an actress who i was openly \" sick of seeing \" in movies late last year ( sorry babe , you were just in too many at the same time ! ) . \nanyway , she\'s really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men , and doesn\'t miss a beat of allen\'s fast-paced dialogue . \ni didn\'t care much for her running joke about him \" dying \" whenever he left a room , but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did . . . yum , \nyum ! \nharumph , but i digress . \nso let\'s recap . \na great looking picture with a nice jazzy score , some funny one-liners , especially in the second half , a decent plotline , although you shouldn\'t expect a real mystery or anything , and some solid acting all around . \ni can\'t say that this is even remotely close to any of allen\'s best work , but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction , especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through . \nit\'s probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else , but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute , \" old-school \" kind of vibe , with chemistry between the leads , zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : annie hall ( 10/10 ) - celebrity ( 5/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - husbands and wives ( 9/10 ) - mighty aphrodite ( 5/10 ) - small time crooks ( 7/10 ) - when harry met sally ( 10/10 ) - you\'ve got mail ( 4/10 ) \n',pos

'when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called \" the postman , \" i thought , \" an american version of \'il postino ? \' \nstarring costner ? \ngod help us ! \" \nwhen i found out that it was not a remake of \" postino \" but an postapocalyptic epic , i thought , \" \'landworld ? \' \nplease , god , make him stop ! \" \nas it turns out , \" the postman \" is a much better film than i had expected . \ndespite being set in 2013 , the movie is , at heart , a western : a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers ; a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back . \nthe setting , however , allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance : american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars , and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages . \nthe struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it . \ncostner\'s nameless character , a wandering actor , rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem ( will patton ) , a former copy-machine salesman turned bandit king . \nour hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman . \ntaking the uniform and bag of mail , he passes himself off as a representative of \" the restored united states . \" \nhe is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets . \none young disciple , ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , organizes a full-scale postal service . \nford spreads the postman\'s message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once-meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule . \nas war breaks out between bethlehem\'s army and the postal workers , costner\'s character steps into the legend he created and goes from self-centered loner to leader of the revolution . \nhis lie of the restored united states becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy . \n \" postman \" is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wide-eyed optimism ( sort of \" sergio leone meets frank capra \" ) , but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling . \nwhat could have been another knock-off of \" the road warrior \" ( like \" waterworld \" was ) surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble . \ntate is the stand-out in the movie\'s large cast . \nford lincoln mercury ( self-named ) is the polar opposite of o-dog , tate\'s character in his debut film , \" menace ii society \" ( 1993 ) , and tate makes ford\'s innocent belief in hope as convincing as o-dog\'s cynicism and brutality . \nhis performance sells the movie . \ninterestingly , as tate moves from his usual street-smart roles to youthful optimism , the soft-eyed patton , who usually plays nice guys , proves a disarming villain . \nolivia williams makes her film debut as the postman\'s love interest , abby . \nwhen they first meet , abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile . \npredictably , the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits , and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero . \nhowever , their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored ( she , torn by grief , guilt , and anger ; he , resisting his destiny ) . \n \" the postman \" is costner\'s best work thus far . \nperhaps that alone gives us hope for the future . \n . \n . \n',pos
'in zoolander , the world\'s most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , \" is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? \" \nobviously , the film\'s creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? \nno , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more . \nmuch like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie . \nit\'s not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek\'s model roommates all die in a tragic \" gasoline fight \" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) . \nbut it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused . \nbetter yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag . \nzoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs . \nfashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed . \nenter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight . \non the trail of mugatu\'s plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller\'s real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she\'s hoping to use mugatu\'s pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme . \nmuch like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today . \nwilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel . \nferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers . \njerry stiller -- ben\'s dad who\'s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek\'s slimy agent maury ballstein . \neven ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse . \nas for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he\'s stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners . \nunfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here . \nmaybe it\'s just because i can\'t stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn\'t had sex in two years . \nshe leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would\'ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role . \nwhile zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days . \nzoolander\'s no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction . \n',pos
'originally titled \'don\'t lose your head\' , this parody of the scarlet pimpernel story was the first carry on to be produced by rank film productions . \ntwo english fops , the \'powdered , be-wigged , be-ribboned\' sir rodney ffing ( sidney james ) and his counterpart lord darcy pew ( jim dale ) decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine . \ndue to a series of machinations and disguises , they are largely successful . \nffing becomes known as \'the black fingernail\' because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up , one with a black fingernail . \nafter the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit ( charles hawtrey ) , citizen robespierre ( peter gilmore ) orders the head of the secret police citizen \'the big cheese\' camembert ( kenneth williams ) and citizen bidet ( peter butterworth ) to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him . \n ( in fact , darcy and ffing are their coachmen ! ) \nonce at calais , the fingernail meets jacqueline ( dany robin ) and they fall in love instantly . \nhe tells her his identity and gives her his locket . \nwhen camembert realises that the fingernail is nearby , he searches the inn at calais and captures jacqueline , thinking that she is wearing a diguise and is really the fingernail ! \njacqueline is imprisoned in the bastille and camembert , his love desiree dubarry ( joan sims ) , and bidet all travel to london in pursuit of the fingernail . \nthey pretend to be of noble stock , calling themselves the duc and duchesse de la plume de ma tante ( with bidet their assistant ) and are invited by darcy to a ball held by ffing . \ndesiree finds out that ffing is the fingernail by wearing the locket around her neck , but she ends up falling in love with him . \nffing attempts to stall camembert so that he can return to the bastille to rescue jacqueline , camembert has her moved to the \'chateau neuve\' , and a climactic sword-fight decides who will lose their heads at the end of the film ! \na more complex story than most carry ons , this film enjoys good production values ( sets , costumes ) and an on-form cast . \nsid james is excellent as the english fop and black fingernail , kenneth williams excels as the evil camembert , and peter butterworth expertly plays the substantial part of camembert\'s thick-witted crony . \nother acting honours go to joan sims who is perfect as desiree and charles hawtrey who is excellent as the french aristo pommfrit . \nalthough it suffers from a disasterously over-long sword fight at the end of the film , it is largely successful due to the performances of the main stars , its slick and professional production , and its better-than-usual script . \ndefinitely one of the best of the series and a joy to watch . \n',pos
'ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church \nsynopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy . \nin a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy\'s head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids . \nto atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny\'s main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station . \nsoon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple . \nbut sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him . \nopinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms . \ni believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film . \nduvall\'s portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs . \nincidentally , in real life duvall was just as \'driven\' in getting the project underway . \nsince no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) . \nin terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film . \nsimilarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience . \non the other hand , the apostle\'s main strength - - duvall\'s preaching - - is also what limits the apostle\'s target audience . \nin terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone . \nteenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church . \nin other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience . \n',pos
'contact is a film that tries to do several different things . \nit is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . \nthe film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . \nthe portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv\'s the x-files . \nthe aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else . \nthey know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . \nthe film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters\' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick\'s 2001 : a space odyssey . \nmost of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . \nscientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . \nthe debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway\'s atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind\'s representative to another species . \nthe film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . \nstill , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . \nthe two \" sides \" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80\% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists . \npalmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology . \nthen again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions . \ncontact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . \nthe film\'s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . \nfor one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . \nthe romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss\'s explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( \" i guess you could say i\'m a man of the cloth , but without the cloth \" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . \ninstead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . \ngranted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers\' part more than anything else . \nthe successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . \neven if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn\'t ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . \ncontact doesn\'t quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . \nand i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction . \n',pos
'billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996\'s sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment . \nas jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton\'s hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers . \nthree men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money . \njacob and lou want to pocket the cash . \nhank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find . \neventually , they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found , and then split the money three ways . \nthings start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan . \ndisaster is sure to strike . \ndirector sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought-provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name . \nwhile there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come . \nscott b . smith\'s screenplay , based on his novel ( which i haven\'t read ) is a fine example of escalating tension . \nwhile it does remind one of danny boyle\'s shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter . \nalar kivilo\'s cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen\'s fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character . \ndanny elfman also does well with his moody , finely-written score . \nif there\'s a flaw in the film , it\'s that it goes on for just a little too long . \njust when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further . \nwhile this isn\'t really a bad thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand ) . \nthe performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene-stealing turn as hank\'s scheming wife . \nthis is an excellent showcase for thornton\'s fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films . \nfingers crossed , though , that this doesn\'t stop him from making another evil dead sequel . \n',pos
'tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently . \nthe dalai lama has made speaking tours , tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops , the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months . \n \" kundun \" ( \" presence \" , a name the monks call the young dalai lama ) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader . \na group of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention . \nthe young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as \" mine \" . \nhe and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country . \nhe is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950 . \nthe peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results . \neventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india . \ncomparisons to \" seven years in tibet \" are inevitable . \nboth films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner\'s point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt . \n \" kundun \" features only native actors and is more of an insider\'s story . \nin some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made \" seven years \" such an audience-pleaser . \nthe actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons ) . \nthe only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character . \non an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts . \nsome events are depicted differently and pitt\'s austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama\'s life isn\'t even mentioned here . \nglossed over in \" seven years \" , the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses \" we were just about to change things \" after the chinese attack . \nthe film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins . \nhis lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail . \nespecially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain . \nthe visual treats more than make up for the movie\'s faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience . \nwalking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience . \nmartin scorsese , known for his dark tales of the underworld ( \" goodfellas \" , \" taxi driver \" , \" casino \" ) has shifted gears . \nsomething of a thematic follow-up to his \" the last temptation of christ \" , this is his slowest film yet . \noddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese , most of these events take place off-screen . \nhis decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable . \nthe stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations . \nphilip glass\'s score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting . \ni talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again . \nhearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india , i was struck by what was missing in the movie . \nas grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is , there is a distance between the audience and the movie . \nthe film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings . \nwith the exception of a few scenes , involvement with the characters is slight . \none of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama , shown as a mischievous boy who can\'t resist being a kid sometimes . \nan encounter with his older brother thubten j . norbu ( a retired indiana university professor ) who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment , but there aren\'t many of these . \neven with its problems , the \" kundun \" experience is phenomenal , but one that i fear most will miss . \nmany people who saw \" seven years in tibet \" will have a \" been there , done that \" attitude . \nit\'s likely that the film will miss a wide-spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping . \n',pos
'i swear i have seen the edge before . \nin fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . \nhowever , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . \nin doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker . \nunfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . \nbut leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . \none surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script . \naction films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . \neven horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . \nthe river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . \nthe intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . \nthe edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . \ni must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . \nthis is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . \nif only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes\' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . \nthe edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film . \nbut taking scream\'s lead , the edge makes fun of the genre\'s cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . \ncharles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him . \nfor once , we don\'t immediately care for the main character . \ninstead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles\' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness . \nthey board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic . \ncharles\' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob . \nas action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect . \nsoon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his \" personality . \" \ncharles , bob , bob\'s assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter . \ndown the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . \ndirector lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . \nhe succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . \ntake , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot . \nthis has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears . \nbut given the charles\' intelligence , and bob\'s uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists . \neven charles himself seems to have seen these action films before . \nmy favorite line of the film comes from charles : \" most people die in the wilderness because they didn\'t do the one thing that could save their life . . . \nthinking . \" \ndespite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn\'t as it seems anymore . \ni have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . \nthe first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles\' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice . \ntamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility . \ni have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . \nwhy not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? \ni guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . \nthankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide . \nbut some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) . \nthe acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal . \nanthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day . \nhopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences\' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . \nalec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . \nbaldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way . \nyou can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer . \nelle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight . \nshe isn\'t in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model . \nharold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed . \nhe is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . \nthe edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language . \nsome of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me . \nthis film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down . \ndirector tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts . \ndavid mamet\'s script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid . \nthe best thing about the script is the ending which doesn\'t end with the normal high-strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift . \nit\'s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear . \nand by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear . \nway to go , bart . \n',pos
'one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , \" se7en \" is just a few steps away from brilliance . \nhowever , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss . \nthe film received mixed reviews upon release , but there\'s an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice . \nat times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent . \nthe shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable . \nthis piece of work is 100\% intensity . \nit\'s uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling . \n \" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away . \" \nthe story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher . \nhe has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon . \nthis is the guy who directed the ominous \" alien 3 \" . \n \" se7en \" is even more ominous because the threat is real . \nit\'s human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic . \nthat is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned . \nafter the most bizarre opening credits i\'ve ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place . \nmorgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society . \nbrad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys . \nthese two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills\' wife ) . \nhowever , none of them stands out above the material . \nno disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same . \nan ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that\'s seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege . \nthe title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in \" paradise lost \" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath . \nincidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found . \nit\'s the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won\'t give that away . \nas i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it . \nanyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the \" sinners \" suffer for it . \nthe two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man . \nthey learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death . \nthe killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way . \nif they didn\'t , it would be one short movie ! \nthe deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story . \nwe see a lot of blood , but it\'s not especially violent . \nthe suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown--like most of the violence in \" pulp fiction \" . \n \" se7en \" is gory , graphic , and disturbing , but all the gore is post-death . \nstill , if you tend to get queasy , don\'t eat food during this film . \nkevin spacey plays john doe , the avenging angel who claims that he\'s the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings . \nlike many crazy men , he has some fine ideas , but some sick ways of expressing himself . \nspacey doesn\'t appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn\'t receive billing in the opening credits . \nhowever , it\'s his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination . \na great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not . \nthis character is so well written that it\'s hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone . \nno serial killer has ever been so creative . \n \" se7en \" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it\'s often a little too depressing . \nwhat it lacks in those areas , it makes up for with believable dialogue , top-notch screenwriting , unexpected twists , and realistic characters . \nthe technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive . \nfincher uses lighting , music , and editing quite well , but his story is always the thrust of the film . \nfortunately , we don\'t find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits ( which are run backwards up the screen ! ) . \nit\'s better to imagine what paths they will follow . \nthis is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget . \nit\'s got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing--the evils of the world aren\'t going to cure themselves . \n \" se7en \" raises some tough questions and it\'s intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves . \nuseless trivia--co-stars in 1995\'s \" se7en \" , brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar--pitt in \" 12 monkeys \" , spacey in \" the usual suspects \" ( for which he won ) . \n',pos

'not too many people know who james whale is , but it\'s a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies . \nif we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way . \nthis is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie . \ngods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale\'s life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it\'s probably a better movie for it . \nit\'s focus is on whale\'s ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) . \nit begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to \" sit for him , \" ( pose for a portrait ) . \nat first , boone doesn\'t realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man . \nwhen he does discover whale\'s sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy . \nbut he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale\'s \" locker room talk . \" \nboone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned \" locker room talk , \" and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening . \nmeanwhile , jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago . \nhis ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor . \nwhat is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser\'s bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) . \ni was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here . \nthis is impressive because his character\'s dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking . \nthat requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well . \nthis is not to ignore mckellan\'s oscar nominated turn . \nhe earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem . \nwhale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield . \nhe rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people . \nin the end , perhaps , it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n',pos
'when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be \" you too can believe whales can fly \" . \nthen it was going to be \" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly \" . \nthen , it was going to be \" you too can believe wood sprites can fly \" . \nfinally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . . \nthere\'s a lot of flying going on in this film ! \nas our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . \nwell apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . \npart of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . \nsubsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . \nto celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . \nin an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . \nafter the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . \nis the format effective for the film ? \nwith a few exceptions , yes . \nthe first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven\'s fifth symphony . \nit\'s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . \neverything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . \neventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . \nthough this segment isn\'t very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . \nthe next segment is set to ottorino respighi\'s \" the pines of rome \" . \nin this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . \na whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . \nhe is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the \" oceans \" of clouds . \nagain , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . \nreportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . \nthe cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . \none especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . \nabsolutely beautiful stuff . \nthe third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin\'s \" rhapsody in blue \" . \nthis segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . \nthere\'s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . \ni won\'t go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . \nunfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . \nsegment four is set to dmitri shostakovich\'s \" piano concerto no . 2 \" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen\'s \" the steadfast tin soldier \" . \na one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can\'t see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester . \nthe jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . \nlittle does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . \nthe soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . \nalthough the ending has been altered from the andersen story , \" the steadfast tin soldier \" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . \nsome children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . \nsegment five is the funniest of the bunch . \nset to camille saint-saens \" the carnival of the animals \" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . \nwhile it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . \nsegment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it\'s the one that people remember most , \" the sorcerer\'s apprentice \" . \nthe story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . \nunfortunately , the segment wasn\'t made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . \nthere were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . \nsimilar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an

'it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less-than-savoury character as mel gibson does in payback . \nof course , if i was being paid $25 million for one month\'s work , i\'d probably be willing to take risks as well , but that\'s neither here nor there . \npayback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake , author of the grifters , itself a fine crime film ) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys , lee marvin . \nthe film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back , by whom we don\'t know yet . \nall we know is that gibson , as porter , isn\'t a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back , and getting even in the process , no matter what the consequences . \nit turns out that the man he\'s after is val ( gregg henry ) , his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters . \nobviously not having much of a crisis of the soul , val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers . \nporter , however , is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet , goes about exacting revenge on the double-crossing val . \ngibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play , that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn\'t mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants . \nyou probably wouldn\'t see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat , out-of-character role such as porter ( jim carrey won\'t be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried - the cable guy , anyone ? ) . \nharrison ford\'s idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin , which we won\'t mention further ; and has stallone ever really played a villain at all ? \nthis is not to say that porter is a villain , per se . \nwhile he isn\'t the sort of character you wouldn\'t want to get on the wrong side of , he\'s nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right-hand men just to prove how mean they are . \nporter is only trying to get back what is not-so-rightfully his , which in a way is almost understandable . \npayback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy-thriller which won\'t be remembered as being among gibson\'s most important work , but is still one of the finer films he\'s done . \nthe only real problem with it is that , while everything seems to work out in the end , i was left feeling something was lacking ; was that all ? \nthe ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute , and the final voice-over doesn\'t ring true , even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film-noir style the rest of the film embodies . \nthe film just ends far too suddenly , after a huge build-up in the penultimate scenes . \na fine film , even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation . \njust be ready for a possible letdown of an ending . \n',pos
'there is a striking scene early in \" city of angels , \" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . \nthe camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . \nthen the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . \nyou see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . \nit is an important scene for several reasons . \nfirst of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . \nthe film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . \nthere are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like \" angels in the outfield \" ( 1994 ) or \" michael \" ( 1996 ) . \nthe angels here are stark and believable . \nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god\'s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . \nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . \nthey eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . \nlike human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . \n \" city of angels \" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . \nhe first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . \nmaggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . \nangels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it\'s not enough . \nhe wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . \nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to \" fall \" and become human . \nhe learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( \" n . y . p . d . \nblue \" ) in a touching and humorous performance . \nsitting at a diner together , franz tells cage\'s character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person\'s skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . \nof course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . \n \" city of angels \" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender\'s haunting 1988 film \" wings of desire . \" \nwenders\' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . \nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . \nand , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn\'t suffer extensive damage . \nthis may be because director brad silberling ( \" casper \" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( \" blink \" ) wanted to make \" city of angels \" its own movie - inspired by \" wings of desire , \" but not an attempt to copy it . \nand yet , \" city of angels \" is not a typical hollywood movie . \nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( \" the english patient \" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . \nseale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . \nwhile the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . \nboth cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . \nryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . \ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . \nwhat is most striking about \" city of angels \" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . \nit\'s not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . \nit doesn\'t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . \ninstead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . \n____________________________________________ visit \" charlie don\'t surf ! \" \nan eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http : //www . bigfoot . com/~jimkendrick \n|| e-mail : jimkendrick@bigfoot . com \n',pos
'capsule : the best place to start if you\'re a jackie chan newcomer . \nroars along , never stops for breath , and frequently hilarious . \nto talk about jackie chan as a \" stuntman \" is to miss a million things . \njackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today , but also a very funny guy . \nhe reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger * used * to make me laugh -- he\'s funny just standing there , copping a look . \nsupercop has jackie making us laugh , scream , duck , root , and gasp for breath , often all in the same scene . \nit\'s actually the third in a loosely related series of movies , each with jackie playing kevin chan , a hong kong policeman who has a knack for getting neck-deep into trouble and then karate-kicking his way out of it . \n ( the others are also worth seeing . ) \nit\'s a little slow to start , but once it gets moving , it\'s a field day . \nthe movie has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind . \nkevin is tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china , which requires him to collaborate with the attractive ( and ass-kicking ) chief fo chinese security ( played here by the ever-enjoyable michelle yeoh ) . \nthere\'s a fun chemistry between the two of them , especially in an early scene where she tries to brief him and he keeps making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform . \nkevin is assigned to help spring a known gangster from jail -- all undercover , of course -- and have him lead the two of them to a noted drug boss . \nthe drug boss , however , has problems of his own : his wife\'s on trial for many of his own crimes , and she\'s got the key to an account with all of his drug funds . \nthis means , of course , endless trouble -- not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while he\'s out in the field , and she sees him with this other woman , and . . . but that\'s one of the movie\'s unique pleasures : the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly . \naction . there is , of course , non-stop action in this movie -- everything from one-on-one kung fu to all-out gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines ( ! ) \noutrunning the hong kong coast guard . \nthere is also a virtuoso climax , which features , among other things , jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter , a wrong-way freeway chase ( which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt ) , a fight on top of a moving train that also involves the \'copter as well as a motorcycle . \nyou get the idea . \nthis is to action movies what a burger with everything on it is to fast food : quick , enjoyable , filling . \nwatch it with friends . \nwhen they stop making movies like this , the world will be a tad greyer . \n',pos
'the calendar year has not even reached its midway point , but that hasn\'t prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar-bait season . \nbille august\'s high-profile adaptation of victor hugo\'s classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values , strong performances by a top-notch cast , a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep . \nfor those not familiar with hugo\'s original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired , the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th-century french-set version of the fugitive . \nafter serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread , the brutish jean valjean ( liam neeson ) is paroled . \nimmediately upon release , he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night ; he is caught by authorities , only to be forgiven by the bishop , who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow . \nthat he does , and in doing so breaks his parole , which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) , who was one of the guards in valjean\'s prison camp , on his trail . \nthematically , however , les miserables is a story about redemption , which valjean finds through his dealings with two women , the hard-luck factory-worker-turned-prostitute fantine ( uma thurman ) , and her illegitimate daughter , cosette . \nyears after breaking parole , valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau , where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert . \nvaljean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette ( mimi newman ) from her cruel caretakers , the thenardiers , and raise the child as his own . \nthe \" father \" and \" daughter \" eventually land in paris , where the teenage cosette ( claire danes ) falls for dashing student revolutionary marius ( hans matheson ) . \nthe decades-spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of , and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english-language work , following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year\'s stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla\'s sense of snow . \nhe and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace . \nproduction designer anna asp , costume designer gabriella pescucci , and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast . \nneeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable ; rush\'s finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated , oscar-winning theatrics in shine ; and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role . \nthe younger members of the cast fare less well . \ndanes is convincing as cosette , but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction ; and matheson , while competent , is a less interesting robert sean leonard . \nas technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is , by the time les miserables was over , my emotions had only been superficially involved . \nwhile i was touched by valjean\'s relationships with fantine and cosette , i was not moved . \nnot even reaching the \" touching \" level is the cosette-marius pairing . \nmy only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical ( as i am sure many others\' is ) , and i was dismayed to see eponine , a friend of marius\'s who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him , almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation ( the daughter of the thenardiers , here she is only briefly seen as a child ) . \nher presence would have added some much-needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance , but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine ( fantine ) was enough . \neven so , as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season , les miserables is a thoughtful , well-made , entertaining film , one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn no-brainers invade the multiplex . \n',pos
'i can hear the question already . \nwhat on earth do these two movies have in common ? \nto most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors . \nas i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers . \nbut oh , how differently the packages affect their films . \nwhile \" everyone\'s \" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion\'s imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones\' script is . \ni left \" everyone says i love you \" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face . \ni left \" the portrait of a lady \" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less . \n \" everyone \" features nothing allen hasn\'t done before storywise . \nwoody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again . \nsimilar situations happen to his family and friends . \nsome of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his \" early , funny \" films . \nthe scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of \" take the money and run , \" his directorial debut . \nhowever , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits . \nin fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what\'s most important . \nyes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story . \nbut what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling . \nand what better way to express feeling than through music ? \nlove is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart . \nsome are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there . \nit also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him . \ntheir singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) . \nbut while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience . \ngranted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders . \njane campion , too , has a top-flight cast working for her in \" portrait of a lady , \" too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one . \ncampion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye-filling images that linger in the mind . \nunfortunately , what didn\'t linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting . \ni remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people . \neven worse , i don\'t find myself feeling bad that i\'ve forgotten . \nthe problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material . \nit was the script that couldn\'t convince me to care about anyone . \nthe characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them . \ni understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives . \njones\' script never simply gave me that opportunity . \nin the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes . \nunfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film . \nin the end , the movie\'s one strength ended up hurting it . \nso here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them . \nwhy ? \nwith both films , my head cared about neither story , but only \" everyone says i love you \" was able to make my heart sing . \n',pos

'insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america . \nas the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold . \nthroughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of `ute\' indians that doesn\'t seem quite on the mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism . \nparker obviously knows his musicals very well , because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film ( he would accomplish this again in his post-cannibal ! \nmusical motion picture , south park : bigger , longer , and uncut ) . \napart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre- \" south park \" parker and stone in their first effort , cannibal ! \nalso offers up some pretty decent laughs . \nthe aforementioned `ute\' indian tribe that packer\'s group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note ) . \nstone\'s humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt\' or revealing what\'s underneath his muff cap . \njason mchugh\'s character of mr . miller is the stand out performance though , as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings . \nas i mentioned before , parker\'s songs are very catchy . \nyou\'ll be hard pressed to get `it\'s a shpadoinkle day\' out of your head once you\'ve heard it ( incidentally , the braniff logo that appears at the end of every \" south park \" episode is scored with a few notes from this song ) . \nother songs you\'ll find yourself humming include `when i was on top of you\' ( a love ballad ) , `the trapper\'s song\' ( the villains leit motif ) , and `hang the bastard\' ( the rousing finale ) . \nthankfully , none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park : bigger , longer & uncut\'s songs are . \nreleased as a pick-up through troma studios , the film is available on videocassette and dvd . \nthe videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman , discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film ( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball ) . \nthere are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films . \nas for the dvd . . . \nwell , that\'s a different story . \nprobably one of the best dvd packages of the year ( and potentially of all time ) , cannibal ! \nthe musical ! \nthe dvd is a massive achievement . \npresented in 1 . 33 : 1 ( full frame ) only , the disc has the usual troma inclusions : the tour of troma , the troma intelligence test 2 , trailers for upcoming releases , but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal ! \nspecific extras . \nthe first thing i must note is , the transfer is about as beautiful as any i\'ve ever seen on any disc . \nthe picture is crisp , clear , and free from any noticeable artifacts . \nadd to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard , featuring trey parker , matt stone , jason mchugh , dian bachar , and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still haven\'t scratched the surface of the extras . \nthere\'s also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film , a clip with trey , matt , and lemmy ( of the band motorhead ) from the film terror firmer , an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film , and finally , an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal ! . \nit\'s good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves . \nkudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time . \n',pos

\nof course you would . \nbut what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? \nthat\'s what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he\'s happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it\'s not for sale . \nunfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . \nnot about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back . \nthe castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i\'ve seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest . \nin fact , it is this film\'s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . \nthe good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . \nit\'s the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn\'t have to think all that much while watching this film . \ni just sat back and enjoyed myself . \nthe situation is one we\'ve seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever . \nwhat makes this film different is its characters . \ndarryl thinks he\'s got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he\'s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . \nsteve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for \" investments \" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto\'s incompetent courtroom maneuvers . \nthe great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren\'t so stupid that they get annoying . \nthey\'re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . \nwe look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection . \nscreenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . \nsympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family\'s wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . \ni suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works . \ni particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . \ndon\'t get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius . \nit\'s just that too often , a film will resort to it\'s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully . \ninstead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . \nwhen they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious . \none of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . \nthe kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film\'s running time . \nluckily , it\'s a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film\'s main drive , is still quite enjoyable . \nwith all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . \ni\'m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . \nand , for that matter , it\'s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this . \n',pos
' \" no man is an island , \" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie\'s themes . \nwhile hardly a great film , singer\'s ambitious adaptation of king\'s short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . \napt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . \n1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . \nbowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd\'s theory . \nbowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden\'s intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . \nthe stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd\'s desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . \nbowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . \nmarching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his \" student \" , among other things . \nbowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . \ndussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . \nall of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material\'s excessive climax . \nsinger has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system . \nhis the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal\'s tics and todd\'s golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . \napt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . \nthankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects\' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . \nsome scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer\'s handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . \nmckellan\'s and renfro\'s performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan\'s finely-tuned realization , i\'d like to single out renfro\'s daring work . \nhe isn\'t afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn\'t do . \n ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) \nrenfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn\'t continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . \nas guidance counsellor edward french , \" friend \" schwimmer also deserves mention . \nhe wants to be the parent to todd that todd\'s own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil\'s blackening-heart even more apparent . \nbut one of the film\'s ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . \nno man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the \" right \" or the \" wrong \" choices . \nschwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . \n-october , 1998 \n * the excellent collection king\'s stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) . \n',pos
'the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster \nthe big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman \nthe most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider . \nwhen those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre . \nwhen the life is that of jeff \" the dude \" leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of \" what\'sgoingonaroundhere \" . \nthe marvelous sound of \" the stranger \" ( sam elliot ) \'s voice-over introduces the film . \nat least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up . \nthe dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the \" laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world \" , although he\'s not so much slothful as he is relaxed . \nspending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn\'t have much of a life , but he\'s having a good time . \nwhen asked what he does for fun , he responds \" bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback \" . \nlebowski\'s passion is bowling . \nwhen he\'s not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him . \narriving home one night , he\'s beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them . \neven worse , they urinate on his rug . \nthe problem is that the dude doesn\'t have a wife . \nhis assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment . \nthe \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor . \nthe next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake\'s mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug . \nthe carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it\'s virtually the only object there . \nwhen he\'s denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor . \non his way out , he runs into lebowski\'s trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton\'s favorites for a thousand bucks . \nthe penniless dude wisecracks that he\'s heading for the cash machine . \nlater he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny\'s kidnappers . \nthis begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences . \nthe kidnappers are impossibly inept . \nthe dude and his cronies are even worse . \nevery plan goes awry . \nyou can almost see lebowski\'s brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues . \nthat\'s the story , but to tell the truth it doesn\'t much matter . \nthere could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining . \nthe narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into . \nthe dude\'s bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you\'d see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they\'re not quite what they seem . \nwalter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties . \neverything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam . \nwhen a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won\'t admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet . \ndonny gets precious few words in between walter\'s screaming and the dude\'s rambling . \nwhen he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns . \ndonny is \" out of his league \" and doesn\'t \" have a frame of reference \" . \nthe film is peppered with people for whom the term \" character \" would be an understatement . \nthe big lebowski\'s daughter maude , an avant-garde \" vaginal \" artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin . \nthe kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers . \nbunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star . \nmost impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler . \nas the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose . \nthe camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with \" jesus \" ( pronounced with a \" j \" , not an \" h \" ) embroidered on the pocket . \nhe addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail . \nhis tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball . \nbridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has . \ni can\'t think of anyone else who could have done a better job . \nbuscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly . \nthe more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he\'s one of the treasures of our time . \nit\'s odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr\'s television husband . \nmore like the coen\'s \" raising arizona \" than their hit \" fargo \" , \" the big lebowski \" demands an open mind and even more open eyes . \na mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen , much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss . \nthere\'s so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it . \nwalking out of the theater , i felt that the film had something important to say . \non further examination , i wasn\'t sure exactly what it was . \n \" if you meet jesus at the bowling alley , it\'s not going to be what you expect \" ? \n \" when the going gets weird , the weird go bowling \" ? \nmaybe there\'s no real message . \nperhaps it\'s just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world . \nmaybe that\'s enough . \n ( michael redman has written this column for 23 years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about \" the man in the iron mask \" starring that favorite of 14-year-old girls of all ages . \nredman@bvoice .

'a thriller set in modern day seattle , that marked marky mark\'s migration from the \" good vibrations \" and \" calvin klein undie ad \" guy , to mark wahlberg , thespian-at-large , and a mighty good one at that . \nplot : boy ( wahlberg ) meets girl ( witherspoon ) . \nboy likes girl . \ngirl likes boy . \nboy and girl begin dating . \nparents of girl aren\'t crazy about the boy . \ngirl steps to boy\'s defense . \nfamily problems occur . \ngirl learns more about the boy . \nboy goes nuts . \nfun ensues . \ncritique : ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love ? \nwell , if you ever have , then this film is definitely for you . \nit isn\'t the most original premise in the world , but it is handled pretty well here , and pretty quickly for that matter ( a speedy 90 minutes ) . \ni think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg ( of boogie nights infamy ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \nhe completely captured all the goodness , and badness , of the main character of this film , and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him ( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience , as \" best villain \" at the 1997 mtv movie awards ) . \nthe soundtrack is also very effective in this setting , and of course , the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in ( look for the nice bikini and butt shots . . . if \nyou\'re into that kind of thing , that is : ) . \ni didn\'t much care for the father/david relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived , but for the most part , i was really into this movie . \nthen again , daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him what the \" big deal \" was about his daughter dating david . \nhis reply : \" the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps , and the girl is my daughter . \" \ngood point . \nall in all , the movie kicked some fun ass , mindless as it was , and effectively demonstrated every parent\'s worst nightmare . \nmind you , i still can\'t tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag , but hey , life goes on . \nand on a personal note , we finally decided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual , and let me tell you all . . . it was a flaming success ! ! \nanother firm recommendation by joe schmoe ! \nlittle known facts : director james foley was the man responsible for the critically acclaimed glengarry glenross ( 8/10 ) back in 1992 , at close range ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1986 , and even directed an episode of twin peaks in 1990 . \nmark wahlberg stands 5 \" 9 , is born in massachusetts , dropped out of highschool ( later got his ged ) , and was convicted of several minor felonies before starting his career as the lead singer of marky mark and the funky bunch . \nhis brother is donnie wahlberg of new kids on the block fame . \nhe is also testing the waters on the acting front . \n',pos
'truman ( \" true-man \" ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey\'s character in this film . \npresident truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature . \n \" truman \" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans . \nand burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc . \nif hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv\'s world , the world where our protagonist lives . \ncombine all these names and concepts into \" truman burbank , \" and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world . \ntruman leads the perfect life . \nhis town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect . \nhis idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky . \nthe radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart . \n . \n . \nbut then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? \nthe next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements . \nhe is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian . \nwhen the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully . \nhis suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities . \nthe world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator . \nthe elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks . \na grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place . \ntwo security guards grab him and throw him out . \ntruman is really suspicious now . \nit gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge . \n \" it\'s best not to think about it , \" she says , trying vainly to change truman\'s memory . \ntruman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense . \nat every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town . \nhis last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world . \nyou know by now that truman\'s life is the subject of a television program . \nhis actions are \" real \" but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife . \ntruman is determined to find out what the big hoax is . \nmeanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman\'s world does his best to keep him unaware and happy . \nit\'s sort of like westworld told from the robots\' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs\' point of view . \nwe root for the captive of the cage-world . \nour protagonist is counting on \" chaos theory \" to help him escape his elaborate trap . \nthe story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake . \nalthough these questions came to mind , i don\'t think the film itself asked them . \nit certainly didn\'t address them or try to answer them . \ni was particularly disappointed that the film didn\'t deal more with the trauma of learning one\'s life is a tv show . \ncarrey\'s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman\'s pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film\'s pacing . \nearlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . \nthe two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn\'t see it that way . \nperhaps it\'s not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn\'t , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here . \nbut on its own terms , the movie is well made . \nsight , sound and pacing are all handled competently . \nmuch of the first part of the movie is the truman show . \nthe scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras , with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen . \none hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen . \nthe music is well-chosen and scored . \nthe film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman\'s world is still beautiful and perfect . \nwhen the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre . \nphilip glass\' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman\'s scenes of suspicion and awakening . \n ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) \nand the pacing of the story was brisk . \nthere was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie . \none of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman\'s idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn\'t necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . \nthere\'s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . \nit\'s a quick , straight shot to the movie\'s end . \nin terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol\'s gattaca . \nboth films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . \nbut neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film \" clicked \" and became an instant classic . \nnevertheless , i look forward to niccol\'s next film , whatever it may be . \n',pos
